"CES and CEM will still exist for awhile, maybe forever due to legal issues. I 
wouldn't begin canceling anything as the Choice customers are still in CES's 
name and we don't want any capacity returning or other problems. They should 
begin to be transferred to NPC soon. Why don't you hold off for now. Larry 
Friedeman (419/878-4760) is actually the last CES employee and can be reached 
in his Toledo office through 3/31/01.

Subject: CES and CEM

I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy 
Marketing on several pipelines.  Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know) 
last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM 
should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.

As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and 
liability) relationships.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Weather Group

Let,s give a big round of applause to the Weather Team!  Environmental 
Finance Magazine ranked the weather group #1 in Online Services and #1 Dealer 
in the United States and Europe.  Gary Taylor, manager in weather trading, 
comments, ""The ""Best Dealer"" award reflects our counterparties' appreciation 
for the significant effort we have made to drive the growth of our market by 
making two-sided markets where other companies are only willing to quote 
either a bid or an offer.  This award also reflects the innovative nature of 
everyone on our desk, and their ability to price non-standard structures for 
our customers.  It is truly a team award.  The ""Best Online Dealer"" award is 
simply another testament to the unparalleled success of EnronOnline.  By 
providing tight, two-way markets online, we have provided two critical 
elements to generate growth in our market: 1) an element of price discovery, 
and 2) a quick and easy way to transact.""

The Weather Risk Management group launched a new product this week:  Power 
Demand swaps.  These contracts use power demand as an index and allow power 
market participants (generators, btu distributors, marketers, etc...) to 
mitigate volumetric exposures.  The first contract the desk offered is for 
the PJM power pool.  On EnronOnline, weekly swaps are available and the desk 
has placed option contracts on this index in the broker market.  Inquiries 
regarding this product should be directed to Claudio Ribeiro (product 
manager) x37313, Gary Taylor x31511, or Valter Stoiani x36906.

Competitive Analysis and Business Controls
eSource, Enron's premier corporate-wide research group, launched their new 
intranet product, eSearch, on December 1, 2000.  eSource's team of 
specialized researchers have created a web site to bring information and 
research to every employee's desktop.  The eSearch web site offers many links 
to information resources, access to research databases, specialized searches, 
sites to purchase books, articles, and reports, and training.  Employees can 
use the web site to conduct their own research or as a vehicle to submit 
research requests.  eSource's researchers and industry specialists are 
available to all Enron business units to provide timely and cost efficient 
research, to work with individuals or groups to fulfill one time research 
requests, or to design ongoing, customized monitoring projects or news 
updates.

Enron Global Markets Fundamentals
EGM Fundamentals is quickly building a team of expert analysts and associates 
to work directly with traders and marketers.  The team is already busy 
analyzing various commodities and market situations.  For example, an 
initiative is underway to analyze current negative fractionation spreads in 
the market resulting from rising natural gas prices.  Web sites to host this 
analytical information are currently in development for all EGM commodities.  
These sites will provide research and analysis, weather, publications, and 
any other information that will assist in decision-making or identification 
of potential commercial opportunities.  For questions or requests regarding 
fundamental research, contact Jennifer Fraser at x34759.  For questions or 
suggestions regarding the web sites, contact Heather Purcell at x54057.

Austin Energy
Austin Energy and Enron Sandhill, L.L.C, a subsidiary of Enron North America 
broke ground November 29, 2000 for the construction of the Sand Hill Energy 
Center, a 180-megawatt peaking electrical generation facility.  Located in 
eastern Travis County, the Sand Hill Energy Center will be a natural gas 
fired facility that will operate primarily during peak demand periods.  The 
$93.7 million project will feature four 45-megawatt General Electric gas 
turbines and will be operational May 1, 2001.


NEWS FROM THE GLOBALFLASH

Coal
The London dry cargo seafreight team traded 1 million metric tonne of 
Capesize vessel swaps via EOL in one day, (Wednesday 28th November). The deal 
was created by combining OTC options and a physically related cash market 
deal.  This helps to bring our YTD EOL to just under 2.5 mln tonne.

Off-shore wind energy deal
Enron Wind has signed a power purchase agreement with Swedish energy company 
Graninge.  According to the agreement, Graninge will deliver electricity to 
consumers using Enron's wind power plants in southern Sweden.  Enron Wind's 
Utgrunden off-shore wind park, completed this year, will generate in the 
region of 38,000 megawatt hours of electricity, or enough for around 6,000 
average homes between the mainland and the island of Oland on the southeast 
tip of Sweden.  In an announcement this week, Graninge stated that it plans 
to market the power to consumers as 'green' energy.

Happy 1st Birthday EnronOnline!
This week saw EnronOnline celebrate its first birthday.  During the course of 
its first year, EnronOnline has passed a number of milestones including the 
addition of a range of new functionalities for customers on the site.  
EnronOnline has now come of age, having surpassed the $274 billion mark in 
notional value in November.  This represents a total of 478,695 transactions 
since the site was launched on 29 November 1999.

The first anniversary was marked by giving the media guest access to 
EnronOnline in Europe.  A team from Reuters was invited into Enron House to 
receive a full demonstration of EnronOnline and as of today will be able to 
quote in reports live prices from EnronOnline.  Other media outlets are being 
invited to obtain guest access during the coming weeks as the word of 
EnronOnline's success continues to spread...

Australia
Enron Australia continues to assist in the region in a supportive role.  
Elliott Katz worked on the GEM migration in Singapore last week with an IT 

"
"team from London, Oslo and Singapore.  Approximately 40 users, including 
Traders, were migrated to Windows 2000 and the CORP domain.  This is an 
important step for the Asia Pacific region, as it brings the three biggest 
offices (Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo) into line with corporate standards for 
desktop computing.

Japan
E-Power, a JV between Enron and Japanese finance company Orix, has announced 
proposals for a 2000MW gas-fired power plant at Mutsu-Ogawara, an industrial 
area  in northern Japan.   A feasibility study will be undertaken to define 
how the project will go forward and this may include the development of an 
LNG terminal in the vicinity.  The nature of the permitting process is such 
that the plant would not begin operations for six to seven years.  This 
project is just one of several options that E-Power are working on in Japan.

Subject: New Power Demand Charge

I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000.  I don't 
think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this 
deal ticket.

Let me know if there are any problems.

This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month 
scheduling fee.  We are still working on the East demand charges for New 
Power.

Hey guys,

I am starting to look a little closer at the sythetic storage and actual 
storage deals being done on the Southeast.

I am capturing the sitara deals and their pricing in order to get a better 
understanding of how sythetic and actual deals are priced differently.

I am also taking a look at how we are pathing this activity in Unify.  In 
order to avoid rework for the schedulers, I have been verifying our pathing 
procedures with Donna Greif (Unify guru) prior to pathing.

As more storage deals are done, I will be sure to distribute any new 
information to you all.

Please feel free to add any helpful hints to my spreadsheets.



Thanks
Trish
Chris,

What month and date is this effective?

Subject: 10/2000 Production - New Power

Hey Chris,

Does this amount look correct to you??  Do we actually owe New Power $5MM ?  
they haven't mentioned it to me, but it's showing up as a balance due to 
them.  could you please verify ASAP?


Thanks!








 Under section four it shows where we cashed Account 6&7 to pay Mary.  It 
shows
entire balance but we only paid out $40,000.


Next question, we moved the money out of Dad's IRA's prior to death,  so we do
not have to show this right.
I need to get from you a detailed list of contracts on TCO that have been 
assigned to ENA from either CES or NPC. Specifically I am looking for RPs, 
DPs and the associated primary volumes. The monthly contract list tracks 
demand charges OK, but is not good enough for pathing gas in Winter. Give me 
a call when you get back to discuss.
 
Can anyone help me with these agency agreements?

Elizabeth...  Can you tell us if the terms of the Formosa Plastics/Sport 
Pipeline deals have changed?  The terms USED to be Formosa got the first 
15,000/day (deal 229875), Sport deal #244626 got the next 5,000/day and Sport 
deal #244627 took the swing.  There have been new deals set up in Sitara for 
November production that don't mirror that.  Formosa deal #463959 starts on 
day 4 (what happened to days 1-3?) and gets the first 15,000/day.  Sport deal 
# 456694 covers days 1-3 but the prices are tiered to include what looks like 
Formosa's volume.  Sport deal #463958 covers the rest of the month but the 
prices don't mirror the first 3 day's prices.  Do you see a problem here??!!

Help!!

try my sheet again, it is adjusted to pool and the 1st is still good. Since 
COH is the only TCO market with any swing, I am sticking with those to 
calculate. We look 5,000 off on 2 & 3. 
I have 41,858(FOM)+15,000 (NP Buy)-53,798(TCO usage)=(3,060) sell to NPC.
These were TCO totals but my COH numbers on 2 & 3 match, adjusted for F% to 
pool.
Sitara #418415 is a transport capacity deal for a demand charge on Transco.

I bet everything we did in June, July and August is wrong in Unify as well.  
I wonder if we should go back to June 1st on setting up this contract?

We don't have that much activity on this contract.  Let me know.

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on ""Comments"" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on ""comments"" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on ""send"" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

capacity they owned.  Can you give me the details on this capacity--what term 
they gave it to us for, rate, receipt and delivery points, volume, etc.  Then

NO.  CALP is a wholesale contract.

Chris,
Do you invoice CES Retail for the monthly and volumetric demand paid by ENA 
to CALP?

Subject: CGAS contract 64231

This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has 
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss 
this with CALP (and she may have already)
     However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.

Linda, would you see if you have a copy of the contracts from CES?

Please let me know what I need to do.

Chris--
Have you called Charlie yet with bids on the three CES transport contracts we 
discussed?   
Also, have you received from CES the official in writing notification of 
their withdrawal from certain c&i markets?

I want to make sure we have enough time to handle all the transportation 
contract issues, etc. for June bid week.  Please advise.

I just entered a deal in Sitara (deal 399824).  This is a sale to Transco at 
St 65, 50,000/day on the 18th - 30th.  I also entered a transport usage deal 
399826 for 50,000/day starting on the 18th.  This deal captures the commodity 
cost to go from our St 65 pool to the SIMS pool.

Comments/Questions?
Not too good.  Hard to tell right now wether its short term or long term.  We 
will have  a better fill for it in about 3 or 4 days.

A friendly reminder.

You were going to give us a list to let us know which transport capacity 
tickets would have to be set up on which business units

Also, you were interested in the ability to create multiple transport 
capacity tickets when you get a new contract.  In the short term,
could the generation of the additional tickets be created on a nightly 
basis?    

Russ.
We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG (deal 281565) and we 
are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June (deal 281565).  ENA is 
paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked.

Angie, these volumes may go up.  I think Tenn is still trying to balance the 
weekend and they are a little long.  Clarissa will let you know.

Per Sherry, Global Counterparty is recognizing CES - Cove Point as the

The reason is lack of the appropriate paperwork executed by the

I will be out this afternoon.  Please call Brian Perrone (703-561-6486) or 
Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711.

Thanks



The total volume was 2139 dts to cover the 113 dt/day imbalance from day 10

Also, let me know what the exact volume is after you do the allocation. 
Hey team.

I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New 
Power) at the pool.  This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New 
Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.  I'm using the 
following FOM numbers

1st-6th  51,762
7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st
27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st

Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through 
the 25th.  Not as much as I thought.
Actually, the deal is for 773/day @ into CPA via the Carnegie-Jefferson 
interconnect.  The price is NX1 + $0.12/Dth; the contract expires 11/01/00.
 This gas only flowed for a part of February and is not flowing for  March.  
CPA closed the interconnect with Carnegie for their own needs/system supply.
This gas may not flow for the rest of the contract.  CPA will only operate 
the interconnect on a day-to-day basis; no firm is available.  I am to check 
with CPA to see if they will do an exchange for this gas.

The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson.  I'm not sure what to tell

I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport).

Subject: Re: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the 
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the 
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John 
Singer).  Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the 
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming 
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the 
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, 
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the 
Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours 
and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then 
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to 
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to 
Enron.  

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it 
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or 
not.  Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on

Subject: New and Exciting National Fuel Deal


We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons.

The exchange deal numbers are 323558 and 323553. 

Also, I changed the rate on Tenn deal 235293 from $.11 to $.0097.

As part of the Doorstep project, (internal audit) it has become apparrent 
that we should rename the Denver trading books in order to avoid confusion in 
regards to who manages the risk in those books.  Since we have completed the 
transfer of those books to Houston and Jay is now managing those books I 
think it is appropriate to remove Denver from the title so people outside of 
the West Group don't think we are trading in Denver.  Of course we will 
continue to support Jay in whatever he needs and provide the middle market 
and origination coverage to the customers associated with the deals in this 
book.

Let me know if anyone has any concerns regarding this and Shona Wilson can 
make the name changes if we let her know what name to change it to.

I can't believe that I said what I did this morning.  It was selfish and I 
sincerely appologize.  I don't know what I was thinking or why.  Well,  I 
just listened to your message and I deserve all of it.  Even though you may 
not believe it.  I do love you, but many times cannot justify my actions.  I 
love you very much, and will call you later.

D
I appologize for the delay.  I was on vacation when you sent the first 
request and somehow didn't see it when I was going through a week's worth of 
emails  .  I have a person in my group getting the information together.  
We'll let you know when it is complete.

Please flip these if applicable.

Hi guys,
Here is a list of deals that I know of that need to be flipped to the

there are any deals that I might have missed.

QM8047.1


I didnt' come across any deals with Duke Energy Marketing LP and ECC in your 
books, so I think there may be some being booked still as ENA and DEMLP.  
These all need to be flipped to settle in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS books like the 
rest of these deals.  I've spoken to Jennifer Denny with EOL about getting a 
program set up for Duke deals similar to ones we have with TransCanada Energy 
and Dynegy Canada so they automatically get booked to settle with ECC, but I 
don't think this has happened yet.  Please go through your books to make sure 
that no Duke deals have been missed.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for all your help

IN THE NEWS...""Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play,""
The Shreveport Times, by Don Walker

""It's a ballot that perplexed Florida voters but was no match for the wits
of first- and fourth-graders at Stockwell Elementary School in Bossier City.


""Disillusioned and upset by the lingering chaos of this week's presidential
election, fourth-grade teacher Lisa Burns pulled a sample of the
controversial Palm Beach County, Fla., ballot off the Internet on Thursday.
She then put her class of 9- and 10-year-olds to the test.  'I gave them a
ballot and had them take a blue marker to vote for Al Gore and a red marker
to vote for George Bush. Then I had them put their name on the bottom of the
ballot and turn it in.'

""Turns out this election was mere child's play. Not one of the 22 students
present in class Thursday was confused by the ballot. Each one was marked
without error.

""Well, if a fourth-grader could do it, how about a first-grader? Down the
hall in Stacey Robinson's class, the ballot was handed out to 6- and
7-year-olds. Robinson used an overhead projector to point out Gore's name,
then asked the class of 24 students to find his bubble on the punch-card
ballot.

""'It wasn't a vote,' Robinson said. 'I just wanted to experiment to see if
they could find the correct bubble.'

""When the ballots were turned in, 19 of the first-graders marked the correct
bubble for Gore, three picked Buchanan's bubble, one picked Bush's and one
marked the bottom bubble for the 'Natural Law' party.

""'If a first-grader can choose the correct bubble, there's no legitimate
claim. Anyone could have done it,' Robinson said. 'A grown adult who took
any time at all could find it.'

""Still, even in a first-grade classroom, vote tabulations were the subject
of protest and controversy. 'I thought we were voting,' Brady McCoy, 6, of
Haughton grumbled after he was told to find and punch the 'Gore' bubble. 'I
wanted to vote for George Bush!'""

Hi guys,

I've come across this deal that needs to be flipped right away.
This deal is in the MGMT-WEST book with Aquila Canada Corp. and
ENA.  It needs to be in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book settling between
ECC and Aquila Canada Corp.  This is causing problems with the 
February Liquidations as I settled this deal with Aquila, but it isn't coming
through the liquidations correctly.  Please let me know when this is done
so I can let Shannon McPearson know that she needs to re-run the 
February Liquidations.

Thanks

Audrey,

I'm in Chicago now but I need to ask you some questions about a few Sitara 
deals.  They are 298277, 298283, and 298296.  They are between EPMI and EMW.  
Are these deasl going to be settled by Unify?  Do we currently see Unify 
invoices/verifications for EMW or EPMI?  Thanks.

DG
Doug,
The Sitara numbers for both of these deals are in the comments section of 
each deal in Tagg.  Do you have access to Tagg Deal Capture?  The Sitara 
numbers are 344737 (NS3520) and 344952&343785 (NS4159).  If you don't know 
where to look for these, let me know.  They were both available in the 
systems.

Darron, 

"
"making up for it through the air.? Aeneas Williams is a tough cornerback  but 
he can,t cover everyone.?  Torrance  Smalland Charles  Johnsonshould see 
plenty of action.?  RB  Stanley Pritchettcatches the ball very well and I 
keep thinking TE  Chad Lewiswill break out of his slump.?  

Indianapolis  Passing Game vs Packer Defense?? Green Bay,s been pretty tough 
of  late ranking # 11 in passing yards allowed per game over the last four 
weeks but  for the year, they come in at # 25 in Fantasy Points allowed to 
the opposing  QB.? Peyton  Manning,snot a guy who,ll go wild for you in the 
stat column but I like this  matchup.? The Packers have a couple  of 
defensive players either hobbled or out and Manning should have time to  
throw.? That,s dangerous.? WRMarvin  Harrisondraws the majority of passes 
from Manning and that,s just the way we like  it.? Jerome  Pathonseems to 
have taken the # 2 job away from Terrence  Wilkins.? Both Marcus  Pollardand 
Ken  Dilgerare solid TEs and I,d feel ok starting either in leagues that 
required one.? Of course, RB  Edgerrin Jamesis a huge asset catching the ball 
out of the  backfield.

??

Even Matchups:? These games  feature no real advantage either way

New  England Passing Game vs Bengal Defense?? The Bengals are playing harder 
for  new coach Dick LeBeau but their pass defense and secondary is still 
fairly  porous.? Over the last four weeks,  they rank # 27 in passing yards 
allowed per game.? Although for the year, they rank # 14 in  Fantasy Points 
allowed to the opposing QB.?  This week, the health of Drew Bledsoe,s right 
thumb is  on everyone,s mind.? He says he,ll  play and is calling it &not an 
issue8.?  We,ll see.? Troy Aikman  hobbled onto the field last week and lit 
this Bengal team up.? If Bledsoe,s healthy, he could do even  better.? Terry 
Glenn  and Troy Brown are the prime guys with Glenn still the  main target.? 
He showed an upswing  last week after a few worrisome games.?  He just signed 
a nice contract so let,s see if he can start earning  it.? TE Eric  Bjornson 
fell quickly.? He  was starting a few weeks ago and now he,s unemployed.? Rod 
Rutledge is the new  TE and would be a great pickup if he,s available.? He 
caught 3 passes last week including a  TD.

Pittsburgh  Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense?? It,s hard to get too excited 
about  Kordell  Stewartthrowing the ball but this is a decent matchup for 
him.? Jacksonville ranks # 21 in passing yards  allowed per game over the 
last four weeks. They rank # 27 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing 
QB.? Last  week, they let Seattle roll up the yards and Jon Kitna is hardly 
Peyton  Manning.? WRs Hines Ward  andCourtney Hawkinsare the new starting WR 
tandem and it,ll be interesting to see if benching  st round underachiever 
Plaxico  Burressmakes any difference.? Truthfully,  you,re reaching if you,re 
digging down for these guys though.? RB  Jerome Bettisis the only viable 
starter on this offense unless you,re in a really big  league.

New  York Jets Passing Game vs Dolphin Defense?? After the Indy loss last 
week,  coach Al Groh was giving votes of confidence to Vinny  Testeverde.? 
That,s usually not a good sign.? But remember, the last time these teams  
met, Vinny went wild with 378 yards passing and 5 TDs.? Miami recovered 
nicely from that  meltdown and has only allowed 9 TDs in the last 4 games.? 
The Dolphins boast two of the best  corners in the game in Sam Madison and 
Patrick Surtain.? Madison can shut anyone down and  Wayne  Chrebetwill have 
his hands full (although he had a great game in the first  matchup)?  Dedric  
Wardis the # 2 WR but I like the rookie Laveranues  Colesto do some nice 
things here.? Worth  a shot maybe if you,re strapped for WRs.? Miami has 
enough faith in  their?CBs that they often leave them on the island in man 
coverage which  can lead to a big play.?  TE  Anthony Bechtis showing some 
nice flashes.? Like  Green Bay,s Bubba Franks, it took a little while to get 
these big guys  going.

Kansas  City Passing Game vs Bill Defense?? I,m guessing  QB  Elvis 
Grbaccomes out of the chute firing.? The  Chiefs desperately need this game 
and it,s clear to see that Grbac winging the  football gives this team the 
best chance of winning.? The Bills play a solid pass defense  ranking # 13 in 
passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and  ranking # 10 in 
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year.? TE Tony  
Gonzalezremains the focal point of the offense although the Bills rank # 4 in 
the league  in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year.? WRs  
Derrick Alexanderand Sylvester  Morrismake a solid tandem and RB  Tony 
Richardsondoes a nice job receiving out of the backfield although you never 
know what  coach Gunther Cunningham will do with his RBs.

San  Diego Passing Game vs Bronco Defense?? Remember that the Bengals 
spanked  this Denver team so anything can happen.?  This time of year, I get 
a fair amount of email from owners with great  rosters?who have to decide 
between 2 QBs like Peyton Manning or Daunte  Culpepper.? That,s great.? Think 
about poor Mike Riley*he,s got to  decide between Jim  Harbaughand Ryan  
Leaf(?? Harbaugh said he,s ready to go and  is calling his injury a &mild8 
hernia.?  He was named the starter early in the week. But with Riley,s rock 
solid  management style, he,s now starting Leaf.?  I,m not sure it really 
matters.?  TE  Freddie Jonesis the only viable starter on that team but he,s 
pretty darn good ranking # 2 in  my TD / Performance league over the last 
three weeks.? Denver ranks just # 27 in in Fantasy  Points allowed to the 
opposing TE for the year so he could do some damage  here.? Both QBs will 
throw to him so  it really doesn,t matter who gets the nod.?  WRs  Curtis 
Conwayand Jeff  Grahamare too inconsistent to get excited about.?  

Oakland  Passing Game vs Saints Defense?? Both these teams took a beating  
last week with the Raiders losing a heartbreaker to Denver and the Saints 
losing  their star RB  Ricky Williamsto a broken ankle.? The Saints have  
actually been pretty weak on pass defense lately ranking # 24 in passing 
yards  allowed per game.? They are better  for the year where they rank # 7 
in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  QB.? It,ll be interesting.? QB  
Rich Gannon will  be scrambling and improvising as usual.?  WR  Tim Brownis 
the primary target but James  Jettand Andre  Risonwill see some action as 
well.? He,s  up and down but TE  Ricky Dudleymight have a chance as New 
Orleans ranks # 18 in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing TE for the 
year.?  RB  Tyrone Wheatleyis looking very questionable for this week with 
two sprained ankles which will  probably force Gannon to throw more.

St.  Louis Passing Game vs Redskin Defense??? We see it every year it  seems 
yet so many teams fail to heed the wisdom of acquiring a solid backup  QB.? 
Both real NFL teams and Fantasy  teams need one to be successful.?  Kurt 
Warner is getting antsy on the sidelines so you know QB  Trent  Greenwants to 
shine for another game or two before turning the keys to the car back  over.? 
Make no mistake, Green wants  to win for the Rams but he knows he,s playing 
for a contract.? Green will be a starter somewhere in  2001 and with every 
TD, his negotiating power is strengthened.? He should fare well even though  
Washington is a tough defense.?  Partly due to the loss of RB  Marshall 
Faulkwhere Green will likely be forced to the air often (as if he needs a 
reason to  pass()? Faulk made a bit of noise  about returning for this game 
and he did practice some Thursday.? Even if he does play, it,s hard to  
envision him as a real factor. The trouble with St. Louis is picking the WRs  
that will score each week.?  Isaac  Bruceand Torry  Holtare the two best 
choices but Az-Zahir  Hakimand Ricky  Proehlare not bad options either.? And  
just for good measure, TE  Roland Williamshas been effective.??  Washington,s 
secondary featuring Deion Sanders, Champ Bailey and Darrell  Green are a 
superb unit but they,ll have their hands full with St.  Louis.

Baltimore  Passing Game vs Cowboy Defense?? Dallas shut down the Bengal  
passing game last week.? Now that,s  something to be proud of(? This  week, 
they,ll face a rejuvenated Baltimore passing game that,s flying high.? QB  
Trent Dilferis doing a great 1999 Tony Banks impression as coach Brian 
Billick breathes life  into another troubled career.? His  primary target is 
TE  Shannon Sharpeand I don,t think that will change for this week.? Dallas 
only ranks # 21 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing TE so he could 
blow up.? For opposing QBs, Dallas ranks # 13 in  Fantasy Points allowed per 
game for the year.? WRs  Qadry Ismailand Patrick  Johnsonare decent plays as 
well against a secondary that will be without  Cheatsheets.net honorary 
captain / enforcer George Teague who,s gone for the  year. That will be a 
factor as Teague's a leader on the field.?Still though, as poor as the Cowboy 
run  defense has been, you,d have to think the Ravens will focus on running 
the ball  with Jamal  Lewis.

?

Downside Matchups:? These games favor the  Defense

Chicago Passing  Game vs Buccaneer Defense??  Let,s put it this  way:? Tampa 
Bay held the Packers to  205 yards passing last week.?  Shane Matthews  will 
start for the  Bears.? I,ve seen Shane Matthews  play and he,s no Brett 
Favre.? He,s  not even a Matt Hasselbeck.? The  Bears are in shambles losing 
another game?to Buffalo and losing another  starting QB to injury.? Offensive 
 Coordinator Gary Crowton is rumored to be headed to Brigham Young and many 
fans  aren,t sad to see him talk about going.?  In fact, some wish he,d stop 
talking about and just go already(? This could get ugly for Matthews.? 
Although, it should be noted, the Bucs  have a tougher reputation than their 
numbers would support.? Over the last four weeks, they rank just  # 15 in 
passing yards allowed per game.?  They rank # 11 in in Fantasy Points allowed 
to the opposing QB for  year.? Solid numbers but not quite  as dominating as 
Warren Sapp would have you believe.? Still though, I,d shy away from most 
all  the Bears this week.? I,d maybe roll  the dice on Marcus  Robinsonif you 
needed a  WR but it,s sketchy at best.? In  fact, Matthews seemed to lock in 
on Eddie  Kennisonlast week instead  of Robinson when he was thrust into 
action.? Whether this is a real tendency remains  to be seen but I,d be 
hesitant to bank on any of these guys too heavily this  week.

Detroit Passing  Game vs Giant Defense?? I have never liked  Charlie  Batch.? 
I think it stems from the fact he looks  like Otis Sistrunk but bottom line 
is I,ve never been comfortable with the  guy.? I,m getting less comfortable  
with each week it seems.? Sunday,  Batch faces a tough Giants defense that 
has CB Jason Sehorn back.? They rank # 10 over the past four weeks  in 
passing yards allowed per game.?  Sehorn and CB Dave Thomas are both big 
players who give up very little  physically to WRs Johnnie Morton  andHerman  
Moore.? Moore seems to be finally waking  up.? He,ll likely face Thomas who,
s  not nearly as good as Sehorn.?  TE  David Sloanhas a shot as the  Giants 
rank # 26 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year but  keep 
an eye on him as he,s questionable (hamstring /  back).

New York Giant  Passing Game vs Lion Defense?? Detroit may be struggling to 
throw  the ball but they,re doing a pretty good job defending the pass.? They 
rank # 8 in passing yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks.?  I 
like QB Kerry  Collinsbut he,ll need  some healthy receivers to do anything.? 
 Ike  Hilliardis good to go but  both Amani  Toomerand  Joe  Jureviciuswere 
talking  gibberish on the sidelines Sunday after suffering concussions.? Both 
seem likely to play but you have to  wonder how effective they,ll be.?  The 
Lions are much more vulnerable against the run so it,s conceivable  the 
Giants could go with heavy doses of RBs Ron  Daynewith some  Tiki  
Barbermixed in for this  one.?  

San Francisco  Passing Game vs Falcon Defense?? I,m still a huge Jeff  Garcia 
backer but I,m not too high on this matchup vs the Falcons.? Especially with  
WR  Terrell Owenslooking less  likely to play as the week progresses.?  The 
good news is that Jerry Ricelooks to be ok  for Sunday.? Atlanta ranks # 7 
in  passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks so they,re 
solid.? The secondary ranks 2nd in  the league with 15 interceptions. They,re 
not as tough for the year though where  they rank #? 20 in Fantasy Points  
allowed to the opposing QB.? Atlanta  has 10 sacks in the last 4 games so 
they,re getting decent pressure on the  QB.? The key as I see it will be  
developing the running game with Charlie  Garner.? He,s having a great year 
running and  receiving the ball.

?

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense

Cleveland Passing  Game vs Titan Defense??  The worst thing  that could have 
happened to the Browns was for the Ravens to spoil the Titan,s  perfect 
record at home last week.?  I,m betting you see a fired up defense this week 
that could spell doom  for QB Doug  Pedersonand the  Browns.? Tennessee ranks 
# 9 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year.? Pederson,s 
been painful to watch and it  won,t be any prettier this week.?  WRs Kevin  
Johnsonand  Dennis  Northcuttwill see most of  the work but I,d have a tough 
time feeling very good about starting either.? In fact, you can pretty much 
just skip  the Cleveland team this week.

Cincinnati Passing  Game vs Patriot Defense??? I doubt you,re still  
interested in Fantasy Football in week 12 if you have many Bengals on your  
roster.? Here,s all you need to  know:? Scott  Mitchellvs Bill  Belichick.? 
Belichick may have his  faults, but he,s the master at confusing a QB.? It 
could get ugly.? On the flip side, there,s always that  shred of hope 
Mitchell returns to his 1995 form and lights it up.? But I kinda doubt it(? 
Outside of Corey  Dillon,  WR Peter  Warrickis the only other  possible FF 
starter on offense.?  Warrick,s always worth a roll of the dice just for his 
big play  potential.?  

Arizona Passing  Game vs Eagle Defense?? This is almost unfair.? The 
Cardinals are already one of the  worst teams in the league.? Now they  have 
to deal with:? Center  Mike Gruttadauria is done for  the year.? WRs David 
Boston,s  hamstring is worse than it was last week (when it was bad) and 
Frank  Sanders has a serious knee bruise.?  RB Michael Pittman,s ribs are 
killing him and Thomas Jones  has walking pneumonia.? Good  grief.? If 
someone goes to jail and  has their wife leave them, it,ll be a Country 
Western song( Unless you,re  desperate, I,d avoid all the Cardinals this week 
against just about any  team.? Much less the Eagles who are  playing very 
good defense right now.

Jacksonville Passing Game vs Steeler  Defense?? The above three offenses  
(Cleveland, Cincinnati and Arizona) make the &Slam Dunk8 list because the  
offenses are awful.? The Jags are  struggling with injuries still but they 
land here because the Steelers are  playing excellent defense.?  Pittsburgh 
ranks # 4 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks and 
rank # 3 in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing QB for the year.?  
Remember, it was against the Steelers when QB Mark  Brunell was benched for 
Jamie Martin back in week 5.? Brunell will throw to WR Jimmy Smith  and 
Keenan McCardell but I,m not looking for a lot from either  guy.? The game is 
in Pittsburgh at  night and that,s a long ways from Jacksonville both in 
miles and more  importantly, temperature.? TE  Kyle Brady has calmed down 
since Jimmy Smith is back healthy although he,s a  decent play against a 
tough defense.

Dallas Passing Game vs?Raven  Defense?? Troy Aikman will find the  going 
tougher this week against a fired up Raven team than he did against the  
Bengals last week.?? Baltimore  ranks # 2 for the year in Fantasy Points 
allowed to the  opposing QB.? Over  the last four games, they rate # 3 in 
passing yards allowed per  game.? Aikman will  look for James McNight and 
Jason Tucker (man that sounds weird)  but don,t expect the same success you 
saw last week from these guys.? In case you were wondering, Baltimore is  
also ranked # 3 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year 
so  Jackie Harris and David LaFluer don,t look good  either.

Tennessee Passing Game vs?Brown  Defense? One of the cornerstone principles 
of  Fantasy Football is you have to understand that the numbers rule.? It,s 
easy to look at the Browns and  dismiss them as awful but in certain areas, 
such as pass defense, they,re very  good in the numbers department.? For  the 
year, Cleveland ranks # 5 in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing QB.? 
Over  the last four games, they rank # 2 in passing yards allowed per  game.? 
The reasons  for doing so are different but they,re putting up pass defense 
numbers very  similar to what the Ravens are posting.?  In Cleveland,s case, 
teams are choosing to run the ball against their  vulnerable rush defense.? 
Why risk a  pass when the defense is begging to be run over?? QB Steve McNair 
will be looking  to WRs Derrick Mason and Chris Sanders.? Carl Pickens and 
Yancey  Thigpen could play but you,ve been burned enough by these guys 
already.? TE Frank Wycheck is still the  primary receiver although McNair is 
spreading the ball around a little  more.
Denver  Passing Game vs Charger Defense?? After a few weeks of flailing  
about, the Chargers are back at the top of the defensive rankings.? Over the 
last four weeks, they rank # 1  in passing yards allowed  per game where they 
faced Miami, Seattle and Oakland.? Granted, that,s not like shutting down  
St. Louis but holding those teams to an average of 128 yards passing per game 
is  strong.? They,ll be facing new QB  Gus Frerotte who,ll likely take a bit 
to get settled.? WRs Ed McCaffrey and Rod  Smith are both solid.? Denver,s  
still using the 3 TE set with Desmond Clark, Dwayne Carswell and Byron  
Chamberlain all producing.? I  like all the Broncos and I can see them 
starting in many leagues, I,m just not  too happy about the matchup this week.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jermaine Lewis , WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 With Travis Taylor now out for the season, expect Lewis to line up as the 
second wideout along with Qadry Ismail. Lewis assumed that spot in last 
Sunday's game against Cincinnati and caught four passes for 25 yards. He 
needs to perform well over the season's final weeks to be in the Ravens' 
receiving picture for 2001.  

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Pollard put up decent numbers in Sunday's game at Soldier Field against the 
Bears.  He caught three passes for 42 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss.    

 E.G. Green , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first game back in seven weeks, Green pulled in five passes for 45 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  He may see some increased playing time 
in the offense, and could even spend some time as the Colts' number two 
receiver in the offense.     

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first productive game in weeks, Pathon caught three passes for 58 
yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  Pathon may see more 
looks in the offense in the coming weeks, as Head Coach Jim Mora looks to 
spread the ball around a bit more through the air.     

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Dilger posted his second consecutive good outing for the Colts this weekend, 
catching five passes for 66 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss to the Bears at 
Soldier Field. He now has 36 receptions for 441 yards and three touchdowns on 
the season.     

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/09/00 
 James complied 117 yards of total offense and scored two touchdowns in last 
Sunday's 27-24 loss to the Bears.  He is now second in the league with 13 
touchdowns, one behind the Rams' Marshall Faulk. He could very well surpass 
Faulk this week against the Jets - he has scored at least one touchdown in 
each of his last four games.        

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 11/09/00 
 Christie kicked his second consecutive game-winning field goal for the Bills 
this week in New England.  He hit on a 48-yarder in the fourth quarter to 
send the game to overtime, then sealed the win with a 32-yard boot in the 
extra session. He kicked three field goals in all, and is now 20-of-23 in 
field goal attempts on the season.       

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 McDaniel caught only one pass for 24 yards in Sunday's game against the 
Patriots.  In spite of the poor performance, McDaniel is still second on the 
team in both receptions (27) and receiving yards (443).    

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/09/00 
 Price caught three passes for 36 yards in Sunday's win against the 
Patriots.  Although he is on pace to improve on all of his numbers from a 
year ago, Price has been a bust as far as Fantasy owners are concerned.    

 Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The Bills' tight end had a solid Fantasy performance on Sunday, catching six 
passes for 49 yards and a touchdown.  Riemersma has historically had good 
success when Doug Flutie starts for the Bills, so keeping him in the lineup 
this week may be a good idea.     

 Antowain Smith , RB BUF - Baja Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith saw his first action in the last six weeks, but got only three carries 
for 13 yards in Sunday's game at Foxboro.  He won't get much playing time for 
the rest of the year, and will likely look to leave Buffalo at the end of the 
season.      

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries in Sunday's game  against  New 
England.  He ran the ball 13 times for 60 yards in Buffalo's 16-13 overtime 
victory.     

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Bradford isn't expected to play Sunday against Tampa Bay after injuring the 
quadriceps muscle near his right knee. The Packers will probably sit Bradford 
and give him time to rest. He is just getting in shape after missing seven 
games this season because of a broken leg. Donald Driver will probably take 
his place as the third receiver.    

 Ahman Green , RB GB - FIBSABs Updated 11/09/00 
 Dorsey Levens had arthropscopic surgery on his injured knee Tuesday so Green 
will likely be the starting back for the rest of the season.  He has played 
well in 2000 gaining 474 yards and scoring four touchdowns.  Green still has 
a penchant for fumbling, and has done so three times this season, but he 
managed to hold on to the ball in a rainy game vs. Minnesota Monday.     

 Titans , DT TEN - Top Dogs Updated 11/09/00 
 It's highly likely that Tennessee's defense is on a roster in every Fantasy 
league, but you might want to look into acquiring it in a trade for the 
remainder of the season. The Titans' D has four games against some of the 
league's youngest quarterbacks over its final seven games - Spergon Wynn of 
Cleveland twice, and Akili Smith of Cincinnati and Donovan McNabb of 
Philadelphia once.   

 Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Howard is expected to play in Sunday's game against Atlanta.  He sat out 
last week's matchup against the Dolphins due to a neck injury.    

 Derrick Mason , WR TEN - Top Dogs Updated 11/09/00 
 Receiver and kick returner Mason practiced yesterday despite suffering from 
ankle and back injuries. He is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury 
report for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Sanders was able to practice with the Titans yesterday, and didn't appear to 
be suffering from any effects from a rib cartilage strain that knocked him 
from last Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Tennessee will rely on him if 
Carl Pickens or Yancey Thigpen can't play Sunday against Baltimore.  

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Edinger is finally beginning to settle into the job as the Bears' 
placekicker.  He made 4-of-8 field goals to start the season but has 
connected on his last seven field-goal attempts, including kicks of 41 and 37 
yards last Sunday. Edinger is now 11-of-15 for the season, including 4-of-7 
from beyond the 40.     

 Yancey Thigpen , WR TEN - FIBSABs Updated 11/09/00 
 Thigpen got a second opinion Tuesday about his injured left ankle, which 
confirmed that he has a condition that will hamper him for the rest of the 
season. He received an injection and was able to practice comfortably 
yesterday, and looks to be on the mend. We'll keep tabs on Thigpen's status 
for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/09/00 
 Robinson is on the verge of surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the second 
consecutive season.  Robinson has made seven of the Bears' eight longest 
plays from scrimmage this season, including all five of his touchdown 
receptions. He has catches of 68, 58, 55 and 48 yards from Cade McNown and a 
34-yard TD pass from Jim Miller.   

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Klap Updated 11/09/00 
 Pickens missed yesterday's practice with his hamstring injury, and the 
Titans are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards his status. He is still 
sore and appears unlikely to post good numbers even if he does play.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Although George was unable to practice yesterday due to a toe injury, Coach 
Jeff Fisher says he would have participated some had the session been 
conducted on grass instead of artificial turf. George is expected to play 
Sunday against Baltimore, although keep in mind that the Ravens have the 
NFL's top-ranked rush defense.  

 Scott Dragos , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Dragos is still suffering from an injured quadriceps and is questionable for 
Sunday's game at Buffalo.  He played a major role as a blocker for James 
Allen when Curtis Enis was inactive.  With Enis back the Bears don't need 
Dragos as much for blocking but may use him as their long snapper.  Regular 
long snapper Pat Mannelly has an injured elbow and is questionable for 
Sunday's game as well.    

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith was limited in practice because of his hamstring and knee injuries, 
but he will return to action Sunday against Seattle. Smith missed 
Jacksonville's last game October 29 against Dallas, but was able to rest over 
the bye week last week.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/09/00 
 McNown is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game at Buffalo.  Head coach Dick 
Jauron said that McNown may be used as the emergency QB if his seperated left 
shoulder continues to improve this week.      

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Klap Updated 11/09/00 
 The Jaguars will be without linebacker Hardy Nickerson, who underwent 
arthroscopic knee surgery last Friday, for Sunday's game against Seattle. 
Linebackers Lonnie Marts and Brant Boyer, both suffering from groin injuries, 
are listed as questionable on the injury report. Eric Storz and Kevin Hardy 
would be the likely replacements if neither can play. Defensive end Renaldo 
Wynn practiced yesterday and may return to action Sunday after missing four 
games with a torn MCL in his right knee. Defensive tackle Gary Walker will 
play after missing Jacksonville's last game against Dallas October 29.  

 Derek Brown , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The Cardinals re-signed Brown on Wednesday after tight end Jay Tant was lost 
for the season with a torn ACL.  Brown had played for the Cardinals since 
1992 but was cut before the start of this season.      

 Jay Tant , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Tant tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during last 
Sunday's 16-15 win against the Redskins.  He will miss the remainder of the 
season.   

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Patten, who has played sparingly the past three weeks with a turf toe 
injury, is listed as doubtful on the Browns' injury report. He missed 
practice yesterday and is unlikely to make any Fantasy impact Sunday against 
New England.

When  the dems say they are &just wanting to be fair8 or +we want all the 
votes to  count, and other high sounding statements of principal, consider 
the following  fact((((..((..

Palm Beach Denied Hand  Recount for Republican

Can candidates have  a manual recount in a close election in Palm Beach 
County? Only if you're a  Democrat, apparently. 

In a September  Republican primary for the Florida House, Beverly Green of 
West Palm Beach was  judged the loser by 14 votes, the Fort Lauderdale Sun 
Sentinel reported Sept. 8.  When she requested a manual recount, the 
three-person county canvassing board  unanimously decided to use a computer. 

""It wasn't that  close. The manual count is historically when it's single 
digits,"" said  Supervisor of Elections Theresa LePore, who joined County 
Commissioner Carol  Roberts and County Judge James Burton on the board, the 
Sun Sentinel reported.  

These three, of  course, are familiar to anyone following the presidential 
vote recount in  Democrat-dominated Palm Beach County. 

In a CNN interview  tonight, Green accused the canvassing board of hypocrisy, 
CNSNews.com reported.  

""There seems to be a  double standard,"" she said. ""I find it so strange."" 

The automatic  recount, by the way, gained Green three votes, CNSNews.com 
said.  

?

You do not hear  Lieberman on TV mentioning this?  contradiction, nor did we 
hear, Kookie, Roberts on ABC this morning? asking? why he did  not.

WE are  witnessing the stealing? of an? elections with the cooperation and  
support of the majority of the dominant  media.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 After missing most of the season because of a broken leg, Bradford is now 
recovering from torn cartilage in his right knee.  He still hopes to return 
for a December 10 game against the Lions.  Right now he is having trouble 
pushing off on his knee.  Stay away from Bradford in your Fantasy league 
until next season.     

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 11/30/00 
 Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England.  Although he is still listed as 
questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is 
optimistic. ""Right now, I'd say he'll play,"" said Cunningham, ""but we'll see 
what (today) brings."" Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it 
would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - 
especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning.    

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 Smith's injured right hamstring has made significant progress since he 
missed last week's game against the Colts, and the Dolphins are cautiously 
optimistic that he  could return for this week's game against Buffalo. 
Despite experiencing a slight ""tweak"" in the hamstring after Wednesday's 

"
"practice, Smith still believes he will be ready to go. ""I feel fine,"" Smith 
said, ""I have no pain in my leg. I'm running and cutting without any pain.""  
Those Fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation, however,  would be 
wise to steer clear of Smith this week. Playing in the cold at Buffalo could 
hinder Smith's performance, which is a chance you won't want to take at this 
point of the season.     

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 11/30/00 
 Contrary to earlier reports, the Dolphins are now ""optimistic"" that Fiedler 
will be their starting quarterback for this week's game against Buffalo. He 
took 75 percent of the snaps with the first team during Wednesday's practice 
and reported that he felt fine. It would be a remarkable recovery for 
Fielder, who couldn't even raise his right arm on Sunday. ""If he's OK 
(today), he's starting,"" said Head Coach Dave Wannstedt. Even if he does 
start, Fielder isn't a very strong option for Fantasy owners who have 
advanced to their league's playoffs.     

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - FIBSABs Updated 11/30/00 
 Enis has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season.  Where have we heard 
this before? During the offseason Enis bulked up to 250 pounds and promised 
to run over the opposition.  He looked slow carrying the ball this season and 
was replaced at HB by James Allen.  With HB Marlon Barnes and Allen in tow, 
Enis may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere.  He is down to 242 
pounds already and would like to reach 235.  Even if he does reach this goal 
don't count on him being too productive.  Wait and see if he re-emerges as a 
star before you gamble and put him on your Fantasy team next year.     

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/30/00 
 McNown is listed as questionable but will be the emergency QB for sunday's 
game against the Bears, behind Shane Matthews and backup Mark Hartsell.  It 
appears that McNown is done for the Fantasy season.  His seperated shoulder 
rendered him helpless for the latter part of 2000,  but even when he was 
healthy he didn't produce too much.    

 Shaun King , QB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/30/00 
 King practiced Wednesday and will start Sunday against Dallas.  He sat out a 
workout Monday because of a lower back strain, but said he felt fine after 
taking most of the snaps as the Bucs began preparations for the Cowboys.   
King hasn't been too productive in recent weeks and don't expect that to 
change against Dallas this week.  The Cowboys have only allowed 185.5  
passing yards per game this season.  But King is still one of the better QBs 
in the league.  He may not have a stellar game this Sunday but will be good 
enough to help your Fantasy team in the playoffs.     

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 McGarity injured his left ankle in practice on Wednesday, leaving him 
questionable for Sunday's game at Tampa Bay.  The Cowboys, who have been 
devastated by injuries all season long, can ill-afford to lose McGarity, who 
has become one of their more consistent receivers in recent weeks. Fantasy 
owners should avoid starting any of Dallas' receivers other than James 
McKnight for the duration of the season.     

 Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 With the shoulder injury to backup Dave Brown, Greisen will likely be 
Arizona's number two quarterback this week against the Bengals. He has only 
thrown nine passes in three career appearances, but could see some playing 
time this week if starter Jake Plummer re-aggravates the rib injury that kept 
him out of last week's game against the Giants. Fantasy owners should avoid 
Arizona quarterbacks this week at all costs, especially with the playoffs 
beginning for most leagues.     

 Ricky Williams , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Williams could be back in time for the final regular season game on December 
24.  ""There's a chance he can come back,"" coach Jim Haslett said. ""We're kind 
of shooting for the last game, but hopefully the playoffs.""  Most Fantasy 
leagues will be over by Week 17.  But if your team is still playing having 
Williams will definitely help.    

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/30/00 
 Owens will play this week against the Chargers but at this point he is not 
healthy enough to take a gamble on.  ""I'll definitely play this week,"" said 
Owens.  ""It's all a matter of how much pain I can tolerate.""   Owens' toe is 
purple and swollen, and he can't run at top speed.  Don't expect him to put 
up good numbers this week.  Use another receiver instead of Owens if 
possible.     

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Jurevicius did a good job replacing Ike Hilliard last week, catching six 
passes for 70 yards in New York's 31-7 win. He will start in place of his 
injured teammate once again, but don't expect the same type of numbers 
against the Redskins. It would be wise to use other receivers on your roster 
this week if possible, especially considering that Jurevicius will probably 
find himself lined up across from Deion Sanders for most of the day.     

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/29/00 
 Toomer accounted for 89 yards of total offense and a touchdown in last 
Sunday night's 31-7 win over Arizona. He will face off against a talented 
Redskins' secondary this week that held him to only three catches and 31 
yards in the team's first meeting. If your other wideouts have more favorable 
matchups this week, it might be wise to bench Toomer.    

 Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/29/00 
 Hilliard will miss his second straight game this week against Washington.  
He is still suffering from a punishing hit from Lions' safety Kurt Shultz two 
weeks ago that resulted in a bruised sternum.  Joe Jurevicius will replace 
Hilliard once again.    

 Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/29/00 
 Barber is having a surprisingly solid Fantasy season.  He accounted for 82 
yards from scrimmage and a touchdown in last week's win over the Cardinals. 
The Giants will no doubt continue to use Barber as one of their main 
offensive threats, so he will always have a chance at being productive.  
Unless you have a stacked backfield, you could do a lot worse than putting 
Barber in your starting lineup.    

 Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/29/00 
 Dayne ran the ball 24 times for 85 yards and a touchdown in last Sunday's 
win over Arizona.  Don't expect those types of numbers this week, however, as 
the G-Men face off against a Washington squad that will be hungry for a win.  
In Week Four, the 'Skins held Dayne to only 23 yards rushing, and this week 
shouldn't be much different. Keep Dayne on your bench if your roster allows 
it.   

 Kerry Collins , QB NYG - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/29/00 
 Collins completed 20-of-30 passes for 232 yards and one touchdown in last 
week's win over Arizona.  He has been playing well in recent weeks, throwing 
eleven touchdown passes in his last five games. He will face off against a 
tougher opponent this week, namely the Washington Redskins and their fifth 
ranked pass defense. Collins was unimpressive in the team's first meeting, so 
you may want to consider benching him this week if your roster allows it.     
 

 Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - Top Dogs Updated 11/29/00 
 Vanderjagt missed his only field goal attempt against the Dolphins, a 
59-yarder at the end of regulation that would have sent the game into 
overtime. The miss was his first since Week Two against Oakland. Vanderjagt 
remains one of Fantasy's best kickers, so continue to start him as you enter 
your league's playoffs.      

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 11/29/00 
 Harrison only caught four passes last week against Miami - lucky for Fantasy 
owners that two of them were for touchdowns.  He will go up against a Jets' 
secondary this week that held him to only four catches and 34 yards in Week 
Ten. It's now time for the playoffs, however, so Harrison should be in your 
lineup every week until your season ends, one way or another.   

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/29/00 
 ""The Edge"" just keeps on producing, rushing for 118 yards and catching five 
passes for 37 yards in last week's loss to Miami. He faces the Jets this 
week, a team he lit up for 131 yards rushing and a touchdown in Week Ten. 
Indianapolis needs this game to stay in the playoff hunt, and James, as 
always, will be the Colts' main man on offense.     

 Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/29/00 
 Manning completed 16-of-34 passes for 209 yards and two touchdowns in last 
Sunday's loss to Miami. He will face the Jets this week in New York, which 
may not be a good sign for Fantasy owners. The Colts haven't faired well in 
the cold this season, losing on the road to both Chicago and Green Bay. Start 
Manning this week as always, and hope that he can break away from his team's 
cold weather misfortunes.     

 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Hunter Shively Updated 11/29/00 
 Chandler will be replaced at QB by rookie Doug Johnson for the final three 
games.  The team stated that this move is aimed at allowing Chris Chandler 
some time to heal his wounds.  It will also give them a chance to evaluate 
Johnson.  Considering Atlanta's passing performances it would be wise to 
avoid picking up Johnson, especially as your team enters the postseason.  
Keep an eye on him though.  If he plays well he may be worth drafting next 
year.     

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Klap Updated 11/29/00 
 Pickens tested his hamstring before Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but 
the team decided not to let him play just before gametime. He is close to 
being ready for a return, but likely needs to get more involved in practice 
first. ""Carl practiced last week, but we felt and he felt if he had gone out 
and pushed it a little bit he had that risk factor of reinjuring it,"" said 
Coach Jeff Fisher. ""I would assume he'd be close to play [Sunday against 
Philadelphia]."" Don't expect solid Fantasy numbers out of him, however, as he 
hasn't had a reception since October 1.  

 Troy Edwards , WR PIT - FIBSABs Updated 11/29/00 
 Edwards impressed Coach Bill Cowher with a 27-yard reception against 
Cincinnati last Sunday, but he hasn't yet put himself back in the Steelers' 
receiving picture. As long as Hines Ward continues to play well at flanker, 
don't expect anything from Edwards over the season's final weeks. Check back 
with him next season.  

 Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Johnson will start the team's final three games of the season in place of 
the battered Chris Chandler.  Don't expect Johnson to do too much better.  He 
should have a good game against the Seahawks this week, but overall the 
Falcons receivers don't get open enough.     

 Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Fear Updated 11/29/00 
 The Steelers have listed Bettis as questionable with a calf injury on their 
injury report for Sunday's game against Oakland. He has routinely been listed 
as probable for games this season, yet has played every game. More surprising 
is that Bettis has performed well in recent weeks despite the absence of 
center Dermontti Dawson. Dawson has missed three games with a hamstring 
injury, and is listed as questionable this week, but don't allow his absence 
to affect your decision on whether to start Bettis.  

 Courtney Hawkins , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Hawkins will be listed as questionable on the Steelers' injury report for 
Sunday's game against Oakland. He is expected to play, though, as he was also 
listed as questionable last Sunday but made the start anyway. If he can't go, 
then Plaxico Burress, the man Hawkins replaced in the lineup, would probably 
get the call.  

 Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Fuamatu-Ma'afala will miss his sixth straight game on Sunday against Oakland 
with a broken foot. He is expected to run this week for the first time since 
he suffered the injury, so he should be able to return by the following week. 
Don't expect anything out of Fuamatu-Ma'afala over the final weeks, though, 
as Jerome Bettis has a firm grip on the starting job.  

 Aaron Stecker , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Stecker is still recovering from a bruised knee and is not expected to play 
against the Cowboys Sunday.  He rarely fields kicks anymore and is used 
primarily as a blocker on the return team.    

 Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs Updated 11/29/00 
 Hakim injured his wrist in last Sunday's game against the Saints and is 
questionable for this week's matchup against the Panthers.  If he is unable 
to play, look for Ricky Proehl to receive extended action as the third 
receiver.  Given Proehl's performance last week in which he caught a TD he 
might be worth picking up to replace Hakim if you play in a Fantasy league 
that allows more than two receivers.    

More Updates 

 Player News?Teams? 
 Eric Bass Player News 

 Lions , Active DT Updated 11/29/00 
The Lions' defense will have to pick their poison Thursday when they face the 
Vikings. Will they double-team Randy Moss or Cris Carter? Or both? What will 
they do about QB Daunte Culpepper and RB Robert Smith? It may not matter too 
much if they double-team Moss. He has been known to make catches in double 
coverage but Carter is a different story. They focused their energies on 
stopping Carter in the first game and held him to three catches for 30 yards, 
but Moss had 168 receiving yards and three TDs. Thursday's game could be a 
long one for the Lions' defense. If you have them hope that they can find a 
way to contain Minnesota and score some points for your Fantasy team. 

 Elvis Grbac , Active QB Updated 11/30/00 
Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England. Although he is still listed as questionable 
on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is optimistic. ""Right 
now, I'd say he'll play,"" said Cunningham, ""but we'll see what (today) 
brings."" Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it would be wise to 
use another quarterback if your roster allows it - especially with the 
Fantasy playoffs beginning. 

 Terrell Davis , Reserve RB Updated 11/29/00 
An MRI performed on Davis' leg Tuesday showed a ""stress reaction on the 
mid-lower leg,"" which is a precursor of a stress fracture. He will have his 
leg placed in a boot for about three weeks to prevent a stress fracture, 
meaning he will essentially miss the remainder of the regular season. If you 
have Davis on your Fantasy team and you're not in a keeper league, it's not 
worth holding onto him at this point. 

 Kimble Anders , Reserve RB Updated 11/29/00 
The Kansas City Star says the Chiefs intend to stick with veterans down the 
stretch. That means Anders will continue to start at halfback over Mike 
Cloud. Frank Moreau, however, might see tiem at fullback in place of Donnell 
Bennett and Warren Moon will continue to be the No. 2 QB over Todd Collins. 

 Robert Smith , Active RB Updated 11/27/00 
Smith carried 21 times for 148 yards and a touchdown in Thursday's game 
against the Cowboys. With Marshall Faulk recovering from injury and Edgerrin 
James struggling, Smith is without a doubt the best Fantasy RB right now. 
Look for him to have another solid outing against the shaky Lions' run 
defense this Thursday. 

 Marvin Harrison , Active WR Updated 11/29/00 
Harrison only caught four passes last week against Miami - lucky for Fantasy 
owners that two of them were for touchdowns. He will go up against a Jets' 
secondary this week that held him to only four catches and 34 yards in Week 
Ten. It's now time for the playoffs, however, so Harrison should be in your 
lineup every week until your season ends, one way or another. 

 Donald Hayes , Active WR Updated 11/28/00 
Hayes was deactivated for Monday's game against Green Bay with a groin 
injury. Isaac Byrd, his replacement, had no catches in the game. As long as 
Hayes remains out, Muhsin Muhammad should be expected to be the focus of the 
Panthers' passing game, much like he was Monday night. 

 Donovan McNabb , Reserve QB Updated 11/27/00 
McNabb was McNasty against Washington, accounting for 262 yards of total 
offense and two touchdowns in the Eagles' 23-20 win at FedEx Field. He put 
the offensive unit on his shoulders and single-handedly kept Philadelphia in 
first place in the NFC East. Up next, McNabb will face a tough Tennessee 
squad who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the Jaguars. Don't expect 
huge numbers from McNabb this week, but do expect him to be the focal point 
of Philadelphia's offense once again. 

 Joe Nedney , Active K Updated 11/09/00 
Nedney has made 16-of-17 field goals this season but told the Charlotte 
Observer that he will play elsewhere next season rather than try to compete 
with incumbent kicker John Kasay next year. Nedney will be an unrestricted 
free agent in March and has been filling in for Kasay who tore the ACL in his 
kicking leg during the preseason. ""It's not that I'm not enjoying my time 
here,"" said Nedney. ""It's a great scenario to be doing this well, but I was 
brought in as somebody's replacement - and when that person gets better, 
he'll be the guy."" 

 Joe Horn , Active WR Updated 11/27/00 
Horn was productive once again Sunday catching seven passes for 77 yards. He 
is still the primary receiver but his numbers could suffer in upcoming weeks. 
New starter Aaron Brooks spreads the ball around and scrambles more than Jeff 
Blake. 

 Marcus Robinson , Reserve WR Updated 11/29/00 
Not having QB Cade McNown throw to him has really hurt Robinson's numbers. 
While playing with McNown in his first six games this season, Robinson had 32 
receptions for 506 yards (15.8 average) and four touchdowns. In his last five 
contests, Robinson has just 23 catches for 232 yards (10.1 yards), with one 
touchdown. Except for one quarter against the Eagles, Jim Miller and Shane 
Matthews were the quarterbacks in those ballgames. McNown is still another 
week or so away from playing so look for Robinson to continue to struggle. 

 James Allen , Active RB Updated 11/29/00 
Despite his three fumbles on Sunday, Allen remains in the Bears plans for 
2001, and why wouldn't he. He is the Bears' starting halfback and leading 
rusher, gaining 840 yards this season. Allen will be a restricted free agent 
after this season but Personnel VP Mark Hatley has stated that he would like 
to bring him back next season. If Allen remains confident he will be a good 
Fantasy backup next season. Look for him to have a big game this week against 
a Packers defense that allowed Carolina rookie RB Brad Hoover to run all over 
them Monday. 

 Sylvester Morris , Reserve WR Updated 11/17/00 
Morris is starting to fade after some first-half heroics. He has been very 
inconsistent and don't be hesitant to bench him at this important point of 
the season. 

 Ravens , Reserve DT Updated 11/27/00 
Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming 
the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted 
yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its 
record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just 
seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, 
an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to 
say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore 
has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense 
during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and 
Arizona coming off the bye.

Dear Loving Son,

I'm glad you are having a good month.  That does not surprise me.  Perhaps
we should turn what's left of your inheritance over to you to invest.  Just
kidding.  Dad is doing a great job but this market is really jittery over
this election mess - thanks to the Dems.

Bi-weekly sounds good.  Let's do that.

Have a great day.  Talk to you later.  LU-Mom

Please direct any questions to Dorie Hitchcock via email.
Good evening. I am hopeful it is no big deal. This is a spot on my left leg.
I had a biopsy a couple of weeks ago and this spot is very active. So, they
have scheduled surgery on Thursday. It is Moies Surgery. They take out the
obvious contaminated area, immediately do an analysis, and if there is still
contamination on any part, they go back in an take out more until the lab
test are clean. Will not know how much leg they take until it is all over.
So, if you have a peg leg that you are not using, I may need to borrow it. I
do not expect any complications. Will let you know the results Thursday p.m.
Love you-Dad

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Muggsy Bogues , G TOR - Free Agent Updated 11/11/00 
 The Raptors placed Bogues on the injury list today, as he will be out four 
to six weeks after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. To 
replace him on the roster, Toronto activated center Garth Joseph, who at 7-2 
is nearly two feet taller, from the injured list.  

 Kelvin Cato , C HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 The Rockets placed Cato on the injured list today, as he will be out for up 
to six weeks with a high left ankle sprain. Houston activated rookie forward 
Dan Langhi, who has been out all season with an upper leg injury, from the 
injury list to replace Cato on the roster.  

 Dirk Nowitzki , F DAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/10/00 
 Nowitzki sprained his left(non-shooting) shoulder Thursday after practice 
and is doubtful for Friday's game.  Look for Michael Finley or Christian 
Laettner to replace him in the starting frontcourt.    

 Lamond Murray , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Murray sat out practice Thursday with a sprained left knee but is expected 
to play against Toronto Friday.  Look for Matt Harpring to start at small 
forward if Murray is unable to play.    

 P.J. Brown , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Brown sat out Thursday's game due to a strained left achilles.  He is 
expected to play in Saturday's road game against the Knicks.    

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/10/00 
 Mutombo scored 15 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in his first game of the 
season Thursday.  He had missed the first five games and most of the 
preseason with a case of Malaria.    

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/10/00 
 Sprewell missed Wednesday's game against Cleveland and will sit out Friday's 
matchup against the Celtics.  Glen Rice will start at small forward for the 
Knicks in his absence.    

 Chris Childs , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Childs left Wednesday's game against the Cavaliers with a bruised right 
hamstring.  He limped to the locker room with his leg heavily wrapped in 
ice.  He is listed as day-to-day.  Erick Strickland will backup Charlie Ward 
at point guard if Childs is unable to play.  

 Dan Majerle , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Majerle will try to run at practice today and is not sure whether he will be 
ready to return Saturday.  He has missed the first four games of the season 
with a hamstring injury.          

 Eric Williams , F BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Head coach Rick Pitino has moved Paul Pierce to small forward so Williams 
will now come off the bench for the Celtics.  He is averaging 4.0 points and 
2.3 rebounds per game.    

 Paul Pierce , F BOS - Fear Updated 11/10/00 
 In a move to prevent Pierce and Antoine Walker from being double-teamed, 
head coach Rick Pitino has inserted Bryant Stith and Rick Brunson into the 
starting lineup.  Stith will play shooting guard and Pierce will move to 
small forward.  This move shouldn't affect Pierce when playing against teams 
in the Eastern Conference but could influence his numbers when he plays 
against the taller small forwards in the West.     

 Bryant Stith , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Stith will make his debut as the Celtics' starting shooting guard Friday 
against the Knicks.  Paul Pierce will move to small forward.  Stith is a good 
shooter and a dependable scorer but has been injury prone in his NBA 
career.    

 Rick Brunson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Brunson will start at point guard for the Celtics Friday.  But he may give 
way to Chris Herren on Saturday when he is activated from the injury list.  
Keep an eye on Brunson.  Although he is not a prolific scorer he is a good 
passer and a solid defender.  He may be a solid Fantasy pickup within the 
next few weeks.     

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Williams was back in action Thursday against the Grizzlies.  He sat out 
Tuesday's game against the Lakers due to a mild knee sprain.  Williams showed 
no effects from the injury Thursday hitting 4-of-5 three-point attempts and 
scoring 13 points.    

 Lucious Harris , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Harris played in his first game of the season Thursday against the Pistons.  
He had been sidelined since the beginning of training camp with a hernia.  
Harris scored five points in 12 minutes against Detroit.    

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Gill sat out Thursday's game against the Pistons because of a sore knee.  
Stephen Jackson moved from small forward to shooting guard and Aaron Williams 
moved into the starting lineup at forward in his absence.  Gill is expected 
to return to action in time for Saturday's home game against Seattle.    

 Ben Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Wallace played against the Nets Thursday despite suffering from an injured 
left leg.  He scored six points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 31 minutes of 
playing time.  

 Muggsy Bogues , G TOR - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Bogues will have arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on Friday, which 
will sideline him for up to six weeks. He has been scratched from each of 
Toronto's last four games while the severity of the injury was determined.    
 

 Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 An arbitrator upheld commissioner David Stern's initial ruling on Thursday, 
stripping Smith of his Larry Bird rights.  Players with Bird rights can 
re-sign with their team even if the team is over the salary cap. Smith will 
have to play three more seasons to re-earn those rights.  Smith will probably 
sign with another team now.  The Timberwolves can offer Smith a one-year 
contract for no more than $611,000. Other teams, including the Miami Heat and 
Chicago Bulls, can offer Smith more than six times that amount.     

 Jelani McCoy , C SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The elevation of Pervis Ellison to backup status has moved McCoy even 
further down in the Sonics' frontcourt rotation.  Head coach Paul Westphal 
decided to go with Ellison in hopes of preventing turnovers.  McCoy was 
behind former backup Ruben Wolkowyski but is now the last man in a 
five-player rotation.  McCoy is a good shot-blocker and a solid rebounder but 
his lack of offensive skills has hurt his push for playing time.       

 Pervis Ellison , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Ellison is questionable for Thursday's game at Charlotte due to a case of 
the flu.  He served as Ewing's backup in Wednesday's game at Miami.  ""Never 
Nervous"" Pervis entered the game at the end of the first quarter and promptly 
grabbed a rebound and scored.  He did not return after the first quarter, 
suffering from flu-like symptoms.    

 Vonteego Cummings , G GS - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/09/00 
 Cummings will be out for at least a month after suffering  a fractured 
cheekbone.  He had plastic surgery performed on the cheekbone earlier this 
week.  Vinny Del Negro will be the backup point guard in his absence.      

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 McDyess played only 11 minutes in the second half of Wednesday's game 
against the Timberwolves due to a stiff back.  He finished the game with 11 
points.  This seems like it will be an ongoing situation with McDyess.  It is 
not known whether he will play in Thursday's game at Portland.  Monitor his 
situation closely.  

 Terry Porter , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 It appears that the cagey veteran is out of the Spurs' regular rotation.  
Porter has played a total of 24 minutes this season.  His minutes have 
gradually decreased since the start of the season and he hasn't played in the 
last two games.  It seems that Steve Kerr is now ahead of Porter in the 
rotation of reserve guards.    

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Reserve swingman Jaren Jackson is suffering from an ankle injury and is 
listed as day-to-day.  He sat out Wednesday's game against the Lakers.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Someone must have slipped ""The Man of Steel"" some kryponite before 
Wednesday's game against the Spurs.  Shaq grabbed 17 rebounds but only scored 
13 points.  He still put up decent Fantasy numbers but had a bad game in 
terms of points.  No need for Fantasy owners to panic, he should score easily 
in upcoming games against Denver and Houston.    

 Brian Grant , F MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Grant had a monster game against the Sonics Wednesday scoring 30 points and 
grabbing 21 rebounds.  He is doing his best to fill the void left in the 
middle by Alonzo Mourning.  So far Grant isn't doing a bad job, averaging 
20.0 points and 13.5 rebounds per game.    

 Desmond Mason , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Mason had four points in Seattle's 87-81 loss to the Heat Wednesday.  He 
beat out Brent Barry for the starting shooting guard job in the preseason but 
is averaging a mere 4.6 points per game and is shooting 32 percent from the 
field.  Barry is currently suffering from a sprained ankle and hasn't played 
yet this season but he may get his job back when he returns.     

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/09/00 
 Fortson continued his exceptional play this season by grabbing 14 rebounds 
and scoring 17 points against the Kings Wednesday.  He has exceeded the 
expectations of many this season averaging 15.8 points and 15.0 rebounds per 
game.  With numbers like that he is definitely a keeper in any Fantasy 
league.    

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Stojakovic continued his excellent play in the early part of the season by 
scoring 27 points in Wednesday's game.  He is averaging 18 ppg so far, a 
major increase from his 11.9 average in 1999-2000.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Brian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale.  Coach 
Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning 
to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23.  Fantasy owners should look 
elsehwere for a Fantasy QB.  Griese hasn't played in almost a month.  A 
player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team.      

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that 

"
"have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to 
be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible.  

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar 
has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards 
and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four 
games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to 
Fantasy owners in deeper leagues.   

 Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them 
going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also 
dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up 
against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much 
as a result.  

 James Thrash , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the 
Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, 
so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league 
uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three 
man.   

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more 
than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games 
prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by 
being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take 
this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over 
the final two games.  

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win 
over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.   

 Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run 
a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy 
value at this point in the season.   

 Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He 
missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year 
career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't 
start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the 
Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being 
bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in 
your Fantasy season.   

 Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He 
rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was 
walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to 
play next Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 James McKnight , WR DAL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 
 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in 
two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback 
situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea.   

 R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several 
team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made 
several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a 
October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder 
of the season.  

 Larry Centers , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' 
Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk.   

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Klap Updated 12/11/00 
 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, 
allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the 
Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by 
this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of 
injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati 
next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs.  

 Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 
carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks 
to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point.   

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 
 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing 
for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a 
touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm 
is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to 
try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as 
Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.   

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 
 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 
346 yards.  Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from 
the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week.  If you are one 
of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to 
Fantasy glory.   

 Jeff George , QB WAS - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this 
week's game against Dallas.  The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 
passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the 
starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday 
against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins 
this week.    

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 
 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns.  He 
gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards.  With his 
performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back.   
 

 Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Top Dogs Updated 12/11/00 
 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also 
bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers 
are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team 
when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday.  

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 
 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams.  He 
will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter 
will be up for the task.  He struggled in their first meeting but still 
managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown.    

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game 
against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went 
down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving 
Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in 
the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' 
quarterbacks all together.   

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game 
against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven 
carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the 
game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of 
the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy 
value to help you at this important stage of the season.   

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday.  Look for 
Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week.  He had six catches 
for 130 yards in their first meeting this season.    

 Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three 
opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, 
could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham 
(groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. 
Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should 
hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a 
better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' 
D this week.   

 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Culpepper completed 21-of-33 passes for 221 yards and three touchdowns in a 
losing cause Sunday.  He also added an eight-yard scoring run of his own.  
Although the Vikings struggled as a team Sunday Culpepper will continue to 
help Fantasy owners for the duration of the season.    

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Coach Dick LeBeau was impressed enough with Mitchell's performance on Sunday 
against Tennessee that he named him the starting quarterback next Sunday 
against Jacksonville. The veteran QB was 12-for-26 passing for 131 yards with 
no touchdowns or interceptions, and was sacked four times. Mitchell should 
still be nowhere near your roster during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Brad Daluiso , K NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Daluiso ws good on all three of his field goal attempts on Sunday, 
converting from 38, 40 and 21 yards against Pittsburgh. He has now been 
successful on 12 consecutive attempts dating back to Week Seven against New 
York's next opponent, the Dallas Cowboys. Unless you have one of the league's 
top-notch kickers, starting Daluiso is a solid choice.    

 Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 
 Ismail seemed to be much more in synch with quarterback Trent Dilfer during 
Sunday's game against San Diego. He had six catches for 80 yards and a 
touchdown, a 28-yarder the two call a ""slugo"" (slant and go). Although it 
looked for a bit like Ismail wasn't worth a look during your playoffs, he 
could finally be at the point where he'll give you good numbers. Give him 
consideration next Sunday when he faces Arizona.

HELLO AGAIN E-RIDERS!


Yes, the snow has started to come down! In very big ways!  In fact,
Telluride has received over 3 feet of fresh powder since October 1 and the
temperatures have been frigid?which makes for excellent snowmaking
conditions. Winter has come, and you know what that means ? YES! Time to
strap on some boards and make some turns!


SNOW REPORT
As the snow has begun to come with increasing regularity, you can imagine
the local attitude begins to buoy. At lunch the other day, when we looked
out the window and saw the big flakes coming down, we made a loud whoop
with our waiter, causing all heads in the restaurant to turn our way. But
when the other diners saw the white stuff, EVERYONE started buzzing with
the anticipation. Folks are getting ready for the season. For a sneak
preview, check out the photo of the day at
www.telluride-ski.com/dayphoto.html.


BARGAINS & DEALS
The best-case scenario for skiing Telluride is to live here. But the NEXT
best-case scenario is that you get a screaming deal to vacation here. And
that's what Telluride and Mountain Village Visitor Services has for you.
Check out these packages for round-trip air, lodging and skiing from some
of America's biggest hubs:

Dallas Special:          $831 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing
and roundtrip air to Montrose
Houston Special:    $814 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and
roundtrip air to Montrose
Chicago Special:    $825 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and
roundtrip air to Montrose
Miami Special:      $929 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and
roundtrip air to Montrose

To get any of these specials, call 1-888-288-7360.

If you choose to put together a package on your own, check out the lodging
deals at www.telluride-ski.com and click on HOT DEALS.


WHAT'S NEW
You can never have too much snow. With that in mind, the Telluride Ski
Resort installed a new snowmaking system this summer that guarantees that
every lift pod will have coverage on at least one run all season long! Yep.
Lifts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 will have better conditions for riding and skiing
from beginning to end. As the hipper folks say, the turns will be ""tasty.""

The tastiest new addition to the mountain, however, is Allred's, a new
140-seat restaurant that is guaranteed to delight even the most
discriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St.
Sophia, Allred's will serve as a private club by day in the winter, an
upscale lunch spot in the summer and a fine dining experience in the
evenings year-round. More on this epicurean dream in later e-rides. For
dinner reservations, call 970-728-7474.

One other great new thing: It's easier to get to Telluride than ever
before. You can now fly to Montrose EVERY DAY from Dallas/Ft. Worth on
American Airlines?but the flight will only have 129 seats, so be sure your
body is in one of them!


WHAT'S HAPPENING
Of course the most important thing on the Telluride calendar is November
22, the Official Opening Day. But there are other things worth mentioning.
Like the Sneak Preview of the mountain on November 21. For one day only you
can ski Telluride for $20, and all proceeds go to the Telluride Ski and
Snowboard Club.

After the Donation Day, you can still get good deals. From November 21
through December 16, Telluride hosts its annual Ski Free & More program.
What's it entail? Exactly what it says. Skiers and riders staying at
participating lodges in the towns of Telluride and Mountain Village can
choose a free lift ticket, a free ski clinic, a free lunch or a free
half-day of childcare for each night they stay. For more information call
888-288-7360.

And if you're looking forward to having a ball, why not do it right at the
annual Black & White Affair? On November 25, the Telluride Ski and
Snowboard Club hosts this gala event at the luxurious Telluride Conference
Center. Dress up and dance off your turkey. No one puts on a ball like
Telluride!


SLICE OF LIFE
Imagine being over 50 years old and never having seen any snow! Such was
the case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the
Caribbean. She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the
snows began to fall a few weeks ago, they were in rapture! Sarah ran
outside and began to dance around (to her 17-year-old daughter's absolute
embarrassment!) However, the daughters both caught the enthusiasm and built
their first snowman ever. The snowman , of course, had a perfect carrot
nose.. An organic carrot, no less. Hey, this is Telluride. Only the best
for our snowmen.


AND SO, E-RIDERS,
That's all for this letter. Hope you're planning your trip to Telluride,
where the snow is always whiter and the lines are always short. See you on
the slopes!

Rosemerry


WHO'S WRITING THIS ANYWAY?
Against her will, Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer learned to ski in Telluride six
years ago. But after a few turns, she fell ? in love with the sport. She
lives with her husband and cat at the base of Lift 7?an ideal spot for
getting first chair of the morning.

On Election Night, George W. Bush won the most votes in Florida.
Not surprisingly, Al Gore's campaign did not like the result.  They
immediately dispatched lawyers to Florida and had a Washington
lobbyist raise $3 million in one day to fund Gore's Florida operation.

Unfortunately, the Gore camp refuses to accept the Election Night
count or the 2nd computer count or even, in some instances, a 3rd
computer count.  Now they want a hand count, even though computer
counts are more precise and objective.  On top of that, they have only
asked for hand counts in counties that are overwhelmingly Democratic.

We have the high ground.  We're poised to win.  But we need your help
to defend the integrity of the Florida election.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jermaine Lewis , WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 With Travis Taylor now out for the season, expect Lewis to line up as the 
second wideout along with Qadry Ismail. Lewis assumed that spot in last 
Sunday's game against Cincinnati and caught four passes for 25 yards. He 
needs to perform well over the season's final weeks to be in the Ravens' 
receiving picture for 2001.  

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Pollard put up decent numbers in Sunday's game at Soldier Field against the 
Bears.  He caught three passes for 42 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss.    

 E.G. Green , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first game back in seven weeks, Green pulled in five passes for 45 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  He may see some increased playing time 
in the offense, and could even spend some time as the Colts' number two 
receiver in the offense.     

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 

"
" In his first productive game in weeks, Pathon caught three passes for 58 
yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  Pathon may see more 
looks in the offense in the coming weeks, as Head Coach Jim Mora looks to 
spread the ball around a bit more through the air.     

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/09/00 
 Dilger posted his second consecutive good outing for the Colts this weekend, 
catching five passes for 66 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss to the Bears at 
Soldier Field. He now has 36 receptions for 441 yards and three touchdowns on 
the season.     

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/09/00 
 James complied 117 yards of total offense and scored two touchdowns in last 
Sunday's 27-24 loss to the Bears.  He is now second in the league with 13 
touchdowns, one behind the Rams' Marshall Faulk. He could very well surpass 
Faulk this week against the Jets - he has scored at least one touchdown in 
each of his last four games.        

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Christie kicked his second consecutive game-winning field goal for the Bills 
this week in New England.  He hit on a 48-yarder in the fourth quarter to 
send the game to overtime, then sealed the win with a 32-yard boot in the 
extra session. He kicked three field goals in all, and is now 20-of-23 in 
field goal attempts on the season.       

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 11/09/00 
 McDaniel caught only one pass for 24 yards in Sunday's game against the 
Patriots.  In spite of the poor performance, McDaniel is still second on the 
team in both receptions (27) and receiving yards (443).    

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Price caught three passes for 36 yards in Sunday's win against the 
Patriots.  Although he is on pace to improve on all of his numbers from a 
year ago, Price has been a bust as far as Fantasy owners are concerned.    

 Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Mean Machine Updated 11/09/00 
 The Bills' tight end had a solid Fantasy performance on Sunday, catching six 
passes for 49 yards and a touchdown.  Riemersma has historically had good 
success when Doug Flutie starts for the Bills, so keeping him in the lineup 
this week may be a good idea.     

 Antowain Smith , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith saw his first action in the last six weeks, but got only three carries 
for 13 yards in Sunday's game at Foxboro.  He won't get much playing time for 
the rest of the year, and will likely look to leave Buffalo at the end of the 
season.      

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 11/09/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries in Sunday's game  against  New 
England.  He ran the ball 13 times for 60 yards in Buffalo's 16-13 overtime 
victory.     

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Bradford isn't expected to play Sunday against Tampa Bay after injuring the 
quadriceps muscle near his right knee. The Packers will probably sit Bradford 
and give him time to rest. He is just getting in shape after missing seven 
games this season because of a broken leg. Donald Driver will probably take 
his place as the third receiver.    

 Ahman Green , RB GB - Ramiro Updated 11/09/00 
 Dorsey Levens had arthropscopic surgery on his injured knee Tuesday so Green 
will likely be the starting back for the rest of the season.  He has played 
well in 2000 gaining 474 yards and scoring four touchdowns.  Green still has 
a penchant for fumbling, and has done so three times this season, but he 
managed to hold on to the ball in a rainy game vs. Minnesota Monday.     

 Titans , DT TEN - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 It's highly likely that Tennessee's defense is on a roster in every Fantasy 
league, but you might want to look into acquiring it in a trade for the 
remainder of the season. The Titans' D has four games against some of the 
league's youngest quarterbacks over its final seven games - Spergon Wynn of 
Cleveland twice, and Akili Smith of Cincinnati and Donovan McNabb of 
Philadelphia once.   

 Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Howard is expected to play in Sunday's game against Atlanta.  He sat out 
last week's matchup against the Dolphins due to a neck injury.    

 Derrick Mason , WR TEN - The Snake Pit Updated 11/09/00 
 Receiver and kick returner Mason practiced yesterday despite suffering from 
ankle and back injuries. He is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury 
report for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Sanders was able to practice with the Titans yesterday, and didn't appear to 
be suffering from any effects from a rib cartilage strain that knocked him 
from last Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Tennessee will rely on him if 
Carl Pickens or Yancey Thigpen can't play Sunday against Baltimore.  

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Edinger is finally beginning to settle into the job as the Bears' 
placekicker.  He made 4-of-8 field goals to start the season but has 
connected on his last seven field-goal attempts, including kicks of 41 and 37 
yards last Sunday. Edinger is now 11-of-15 for the season, including 4-of-7 
from beyond the 40.     

 Yancey Thigpen , WR TEN - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Thigpen got a second opinion Tuesday about his injured left ankle, which 
confirmed that he has a condition that will hamper him for the rest of the 
season. He received an injection and was able to practice comfortably 
yesterday, and looks to be on the mend. We'll keep tabs on Thigpen's status 
for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 11/09/00 
 Robinson is on the verge of surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the second 
consecutive season.  Robinson has made seven of the Bears' eight longest 
plays from scrimmage this season, including all five of his touchdown 
receptions. He has catches of 68, 58, 55 and 48 yards from Cade McNown and a 
34-yard TD pass from Jim Miller.   

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/09/00 
 Pickens missed yesterday's practice with his hamstring injury, and the 
Titans are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards his status. He is still 
sore and appears unlikely to post good numbers even if he does play.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Although George was unable to practice yesterday due to a toe injury, Coach 
Jeff Fisher says he would have participated some had the session been 
conducted on grass instead of artificial turf. George is expected to play 
Sunday against Baltimore, although keep in mind that the Ravens have the 
NFL's top-ranked rush defense.  

 Scott Dragos , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Dragos is still suffering from an injured quadriceps and is questionable for 
Sunday's game at Buffalo.  He played a major role as a blocker for James 
Allen when Curtis Enis was inactive.  With Enis back the Bears don't need 
Dragos as much for blocking but may use him as their long snapper.  Regular 
long snapper Pat Mannelly has an injured elbow and is questionable for 
Sunday's game as well.    

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Murder Inc. Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith was limited in practice because of his hamstring and knee injuries, 
but he will return to action Sunday against Seattle. Smith missed 
Jacksonville's last game October 29 against Dallas, but was able to rest over 
the bye week last week.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 McNown is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game at Buffalo.  Head coach Dick 
Jauron said that McNown may be used as the emergency QB if his seperated left 
shoulder continues to improve this week.      

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/09/00 
 The Jaguars will be without linebacker Hardy Nickerson, who underwent 
arthroscopic knee surgery last Friday, for Sunday's game against Seattle. 
Linebackers Lonnie Marts and Brant Boyer, both suffering from groin injuries, 
are listed as questionable on the injury report. Eric Storz and Kevin Hardy 
would be the likely replacements if neither can play. Defensive end Renaldo 
Wynn practiced yesterday and may return to action Sunday after missing four 
games with a torn MCL in his right knee. Defensive tackle Gary Walker will 
play after missing Jacksonville's last game against Dallas October 29.  

 Derek Brown , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The Cardinals re-signed Brown on Wednesday after tight end Jay Tant was lost 
for the season with a torn ACL.  Brown had played for the Cardinals since 
1992 but was cut before the start of this season.      

 Jay Tant , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Tant tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during last 
Sunday's 16-15 win against the Redskins.  He will miss the remainder of the 
season.   

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Patten, who has played sparingly the past three weeks with a turf toe 
injury, is listed as doubtful on the Browns' injury report. He missed 
practice yesterday and is unlikely to make any Fantasy impact Sunday against 
New England.

Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4

Gore Calls For Recount Of Supreme Court Vote

WASHINGTON, DC-- An increasingly desperate Al Gore called for a recount 
Tuesday of the 
U.S. Supreme Court's 9-0 decision in Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing 
Board. ""There 
is reason to suspect that these nine votes were not properly counted and that 
as many as five 
justices who sided with Mr. Bush did not intend to do so,"" Gore said. ""It is 
therefore in the best 
interest of our democracy for the U.S. Supreme Court to suspend judgment in 
this case until we 
can be absolutely certain that this court did, in fact, intend to rule in Mr. 
Bush's favor."" Gore added 
that if his recount request is denied, he will file an appeal with the 
Interplanetary Supreme Court.

Enron and Andersen Consulting are proud to sponsor the 2nd Annual 
Aggie-Longhorn 
Flag Football Challenge on Saturday, November 18.  The purpose of this event 
is to 
raise money for both schools, and to enjoy the competitive spirit of the 
third oldest rivalry 
in college football.  This year's game marks the 107th meeting between Texas 
A&M 
University and The University of Texas, and, with a little luck, the Big 12 
South Title 
will be on the line!

Enron and Andersen Consulting are sponsoring the event, but we need your help 
as 
participants and fundraisers.  Contributions raised will benefit the general 
scholarship fund 
for each school. 

The details: 
Date:    Saturday, November 18th 

Time:    10:00 a.m. - approximately 4 p.m. (Warm up is at 9:30 am)

Location:   Stratford High School Practice Fields (just off Dairy Ashford, 
south of I-10)

Food and Drinks:  Schulze,s BBQ (FREE - courtesy of Enron)

Eligibility:   Full-time employees and/or their spouses
    (Players must have graduated from Texas A&M
 or The University of Texas )

Team Jerseys:  Provided by Enron and Andersen Consulting 

Format:   7 players with at least 1 female player on the field at all times

Team Size: Recommend 8-10 players per team (no more than 10 per team) 
 Contact the team captains to sign-up.  (Sign-up now to ensure your 
 place on a team)

Prizes:    Winning team receives 16 tickets to the A&M/UT game in 
Austin on Friday, November 24
    Winning team also owns the ""Horns Down/Horns Up"" trophy 
until next year!

Fundraising Goal  The committee has set a goal of raising $16,000 for each 
school.  This will require a contribution of $2,000 per team, 
plus an equal amount from corporate matching funds.

Last year's event featured a last-minute comeback as the Enron Aggies Team 1 
defeated the Enron 
Longhorns Team 1 for the championship and took home the tickets and the 
trophy.  This year, expect 
the Longhorns (and Andersen Consulting) to come in with revenge on their 
minds! 

Thanks to the gracious gift from the UT Alumni, who redirected their 
donations to the A&M Foundation, 
we were able to permanently endow scholarships dedicated to the memory of the 
12 Aggies who died 
in last year's Bonfire collapse.  We believe this event is a great tradition 
for both companies, and we are 
pleased to be able to raise important funds for both institutions.

If you are interested in participating or otherwise being involved, you must 
contact one of the team captains 
below by the close of business on Friday, November 3 (phone or email).  Team 
rosters will be filled on a 
first-come, first-served basis.

Hi Folks,

Once again, we tap Mike McVay, our Meteorologist / Fantasy Football Fanatic
for some insights.  I know many of you have lineup deadlines today.  We'll
try to get one last update from Mike on Saturday.

Thanks Mike!

Joe




SEATTLE @ DENVER:  The latest on the potential for a snow storm in Denver
this weekend does look a little more promising for McCaffrey, Smith and
Frerotte owners.  The cold air and snow may hold off until after gametime.
Winds will be a concern and this forecast could go either way still, but the
trend is toward a Sunday night snow storm (as of Friday morning).  Frerotte
is likely the only ""bubble"" player listed above, but if you cannot wait
until late Saturday for the last update, I wouldn't be afraid to use him at
this point if he's your best option.

DETROIT @ GREEN BAY:  This one still looks ugly.  Cold, windy and snow is
likely in Green Bay this weekend.  This is not a major snow storm and the
Packers (especially Favre) seem to thrive when it's nasty out.  Packer
players should be ""ok"", but if you have ""bubble"" players with Detroit, you
might want to consider another option.

CAROLINA @ KANSAS CITY:  A cold rain is still in store for the
Chiefs/Panthers game at Arrowhead Stadium.  The Chiefs lack of a running
game could translate to turnovers favoring the Panthers.

HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potential 
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown 
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office 
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from the 
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators.  
This defeats security. 

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. Do 
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major 
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieves 
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewer 
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you see 
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call 
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawer 
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload 
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe 
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things don,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near a 
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive. 

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages 
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise you 
as to company guidelines.
Hi Folks, 
?
Just a few quick notes on this short Thanksgiving  week.
?
?
?
No Problems for Faulk / Kurt Warner  One more Week:? From USA Today's?Ram's 
Page:? ""In other  injury news, Marshall Faulk experienced no problems with 
his right knee the day  after the game. Martz said quarterback Kurt Warner 
almost certainly would miss  one more game before returning from a broken 
little finger on his throwing hand.  Two pins were removed from Warner's 
finger Monday and he'll throw Wednesday  through Friday in practice, but will 
not take any snaps. ''(The doctors) want  him to have another week before 
that hand is jarred by anything, just to make  sure it sets real well,'' 
Martz said. 
?
It should be noted that Warner is more optimistic  about playing than his 

"
"coach is.? Don't take the coach's word as  gospel.? Remember, it was Martz 
who?a few days ago?was saying  Faulk likely wouldn't play Monday night and if 
he did, he'd be very  limited.? I'm not saying he's less than truthful.? I'm 
saying these  things change.? If I had to guess though, I'd say it's one more 
week of  Trent Green.
?
?
?
Tony Horne Out 6 Weeks:? From  USA Today: Tony Horne will be sidelined an 
estimated six weeks with a ligament  damage to his left big toe. Coach Mike 
Martz described the injury Tuesday as  ''severe turf toe.''? He'll likely be 
replaced by CB Dre Bly.
?
?
Ray Crockett Hamstring:?  Denver CB Ray Crockett tore his hamstring Sunday.? 
You may have seen it  when he went down and Ryan Leaf was able to hit Jeff 
Graham for the long  TD.? It looked pretty bad.? I thought he'd dislocated 
his hip the way  he pulled up.? Jimmy Spencer will fill in.?That hurts as the 
team gets  ready for Seattle.? The Seahawks are no passing juggernaut but 
neither were  the Chargers...
?
?
Mike Alstott Done? Tampa Bay  is calling Mike Alstott's knee injury a 3rd 
degree sprain of the medial  collateral ligament (MCL) and he'll likely miss 
6-8 weeks which of course means  he's done for FF purposes.? His leg is being 
placed in a cast for 10  days.? Surgery doesn't look to be required and it's 
a tough blow for the  big guy.? Look for more carries from Warrick Dunn.
?
?
Curtis Martin  Questions?? I've had a ton of requests for more info on the  
Curtis Martin situation which is now being called a hip injury instead of a  
lower back injury.? Coach Al Groh is being his usual guarded self with the  
""if he plays he plays"" type comments.? We'll know more here soon and will  
shoot it to you.? 
?
?
Scott Mitchell  Improving??? CBS Sportsline is reporting Scott  Mitchell's 
sprained knee is improving.?? He's listed as doubtful but  is reportedly 
making good progress.? With visions of Akili Smith in their  heads, I'm sure 
he's getting lots of encouragement.? Seems weird to be  getting excited about 
Scott Mitchell but the truth is he looked pretty good  Sunday.? His play was 
great news for Peter Warrick fans.? He makes  Corey Dillon better too.
?
?
Jeff George to Start??  Coach Norv Turner said today that unless Brad 
Johnson's knee is 100% healthy,  Jeff George would start.? Most reports are 
that Johnson's knee is not 100%  yet.? One more great game from George and 
this will be very  interesting.
?
?
Donald Hayes 50/50??  KFFL.com is reporting George Seifert said that WR 
Donald Hayes is questionable  for this week's game with a bad groin.?RB 
Tshimanga Biakabutuka is still  hobbled with a bad foot so the Panthers can 
ill afford to lose Hayes  too.
?
?
James Stewart Hopeful??  KFFL.com is reporting: ""James Stewart (hip pointer) 
and Mario Bates (knee) were  wearing red jerseys during Monday's practice. 
Red jerseys mean the players  aren't allowed to be hit. Lions head coach Gary 
Moeller stated he thinks Stewart  will be able to play Thursday against the 
Patriots. 
?
?
?
These are just a few quick ones for you.?  We'll have our full blown Players 
in the News Wednesday night.? See you  then.
?

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Mean Machine Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - FDIC Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.  

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Christie was held without a point in last week's game against the Dolphins, 
but don't expect the same this week against the Colts. Christie is a solid 
Fantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between 
two teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.  

 Sylvester Morris , WR KC - FDIC Updated 12/08/00 
 Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the 
Kansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics. ""I 
missed the majority of camp, so there's not that much wear and tear on me, 
but it's still a long season,"" he said. ""It's not so bad physically. But 
every morning I get up early, earlier than I ever had to in college. In 
college, you could schedule your classes. I never had a class before 10 
o'clock. Now I'm (at the practice facility) by 8 every day. That's a 
difference.""

Well, the closest one I know is the Crescent Court and that is REAL nice and
REAL expensive.  There are La Quintas and other shitty places scattered all
around there.  Of course in Downtown Dallas you could probably find quite a
few decent places to stay and that is real close to the cotton bowl.  Here
are some other possibilities:

Where are you going to be, that puts you on that side of town?

"On another note, do you know of any hotels in the cotton bowl area in
Dallas?
Latest Terrell Davis Info  From Adam Schefter in the Denver Post:  From the
article   http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/brnx1121b.htm   ""This is the
kind of season it has been for Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis: He
has twice as many magnetic resonance imaging tests as touchdowns.
Davis underwent his fourth MRI on Monday and, like the previous three, the
results were negative. Yet Davis still is concerned enough about his lower
left leg, which has been bothering him for nearly a month and wants a
specialist in San Francisco to study the results.
""It's just kind of a cross-check with a guy that's known to be pretty good,""
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ""He's still quite sore, and we want to
make sure that we rule out all possibilities.""
But not even the specialist in San Francisco will be able to predict whether
Davis will be able to play Sunday in Seattle, or any time in the near
future.
""I thought he was going to play this last week; then he set it back and
didn't practice Saturday morning,"" Shanahan said. ""I don't think anybody
knows. We just have to wait and see.""
At this point, the Broncos are carrying on as if rookie running backs Mike
Anderson and KaRon Coleman will be carrying the load. ""You've got to,""
Shanahan said. ""If he's there, it's a plus, and we'd like him to be there
full speed.
""But he keeps on setting that leg back. How long that pain's going to be
there I don't think anybody knows. We'll just have to go on. Mike Anderson
did a great job last game, played exceptionally well, and he has got to pick
up the slack.''



My View:   Mike Shanahan is no Bill Belichick, when it comes to coachspeak,
but he's not far behind.  He's saying basically the only things he can say.
If I'm a Terrell Davis owner, I probably sit him this week unless I just
didn't have many other options.  I'd say the chances of him playing
effectively this week are in the 40% range.  Anderson had 138 total yards
Sunday.  He ran for 97 yards on 19 carries for a 5.1 yard per carry average.
And that was against a San Diego rush defense that was ranked # 2 in rushing
yards allowed per game over the last four games.  In other words, the
running game isn't a big problem for Mike Shanahan right now.  He's got
other things to worry about (like replacing CB Ray Crockett).  The fact they
haven't been able to nail down the exact problem is worrisome to me.  Bottom
line is I'm thinking Anderson as of right now.

Good Luck!

Joe

News galore....let's jump into it


Quarterbacks in the News:

QB Chris Chandler (Atl) is doubtful with a concussion. He has not
practiced all week. QB Danny Kanell will start in his place.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is expected to sit another week with a sore
shoulder. Doug Flutie gets the start again.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) still cannot throw and will not play this week.
Jim Miller starts in his absence.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) will start this week, but the coaches may give
him the quick hook should he struggle.

QB Troy Aikman (Dal) practiced with the first team Thursday and is
expected to start this week. If he cannot go because of his back,
Cliff Stoerner would start. Randall Cunningham is also hurt with a
sore knee and has not practiced.

QB Brian Griese (Den) continues to play through his ailments. This
week will be no different.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) has recovered from his concussion and is
expected to start this week.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) is expected to play with a sore elbow. Hint to
team, Maybe try throwing for less than 500 yards?

QB Daunte Culpepper (Min) does not appear on the injury report, but
has a sore knee. He is expected to start this week.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) was seen wearing a splint and did not practice
on Wednesday. The team is being very mum whether he will play or not.
John Friesz would get the start in his absence, but the team could
also use Michael Bishop if Friesz struggles. This is likely a
situation you should avoid if at all possible.

QB Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) still has a stiff neck, but has played
through it the last two weeks. Expect the same this week.

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit) gets the start this week.

QB Jim Harbaugh (SD) is listed as questionable, but he will not
start. The team named Moses Moreno the starter earlier in the week.

QB Brock Huard (Sea) is not fully over his concussion. He is expected
to sit this week. Jon Kitna will get the start.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) is out for another 2-3 weeks.

QB Shaun King (TB) has tonsilitis, but is expected to play on Sunday.
He practiced on Thursday.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) will likely be added today to the injury report
with a sore back. He expects to play on Sunday though.

QB Jeff George (Was) is on a bye this week and will not play.

//////////////////////////////////////

players on the injury report. He will start on Sunday.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) has two sprained ankles and was held out of
practice on Wednesday. He played through the pain last week, but
looks as if he is in worse shape this week. He will likely be a game-
time decision which is ugly since he plays on Monday Night. We will
keep you posted regarding any breaking news regarding his status.

RB Amp Lee (Phi) is expected to play with a sore back.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out for the next three weeks.

wrist.

//////////////////////////////////////

play this week.

expected to play this week.

with a sore quadricep. He is listed as questionable on the injury
report.

practices
with a very tender toe. He's listed as questionable and could be
a
game-time decision. Tai Streets and JJ Stokes will see extra action
if Owens can not go.

WR Derrick Mason (Ten) is the least hurt of all the receivers and
will start on Sunday. He is battling a sore back and ankle. He
practiced on Thursday.

WR Chris Sanders (Ten) is listed as questionable on the injury
report, but expects to start with his sore back and ribs. He
practiced on Thursday.

WR Yancey Thigpen (Ten) shockingly appears on the injury report as
questionable this week. For those that have followed his career, this
usually means he will not play.

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) is still bothered by a hamstring and was not
able to practice at full speed. He is not likely to make much of an
impact this week.

WR Kenny Shedd (FA) was signed by Washington.

//////////////////////////////////////

practiced on Wednesday and Thursday.

kicking on Sunday.

PK Sebastian Janikowski (Oak) left the hospital so he may go on
Monday. He is listed as questionable, but has not practiced. The
Raiders have looked at Brett Conway and Chris Boniol, but have not
signed either one. We will watch this one close for you Friday and
Saturday.

was signed earlier in the week and will perform kickoffs and is the
backup to Jeff if he can't kick.

PK Scott Bentley (FA) was signed by Washington.

PK Kris Heppner (Was) was released after his several miscues cost the
team a victory this past week.

HELLO AGAIN E-RIDERS!


Yes, the snow has started to come down! In very big ways!  In fact,
Telluride has received over 3 feet of fresh powder since October 1 and the
temperatures have been frigid?which makes for excellent snowmaking
conditions. Winter has come, and you know what that means ? YES! Time to
strap on some boards and make some turns!


SNOW REPORT
As the snow has begun to come with increasing regularity, you can imagine
the local attitude begins to buoy. At lunch the other day, when we looked
out the window and saw the big flakes coming down, we made a loud whoop
with our waiter, causing all heads in the restaurant to turn our way. But
when the other diners saw the white stuff, EVERYONE started buzzing with
the anticipation. Folks are getting ready for the season. For a sneak
preview, check out the photo of the day at
www.telluride-ski.com/dayphoto.html.


BARGAINS & DEALS
The best-case scenario for skiing Telluride is to live here. But the NEXT
best-case scenario is that you get a screaming deal to vacation here. And
that's what Telluride and Mountain Village Visitor Services has for you.
Check out these packages for round-trip air, lodging and skiing from some
of America's biggest hubs:

Dallas Special:          $831 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing
and roundtrip air to Montrose
Houston Special:    $814 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and
roundtrip air to Montrose
Chicago Special:    $825 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and
roundtrip air to Montrose
Miami Special:      $929 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and
roundtrip air to Montrose

To get any of these specials, call 1-888-288-7360.

If you choose to put together a package on your own, check out the lodging
deals at www.telluride-ski.com and click on HOT DEALS.


WHAT'S NEW
You can never have too much snow. With that in mind, the Telluride Ski
Resort installed a new snowmaking system this summer that guarantees that
every lift pod will have coverage on at least one run all season long! Yep.
Lifts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 will have better conditions for riding and skiing
from beginning to end. As the hipper folks say, the turns will be ""tasty.""

The tastiest new addition to the mountain, however, is Allred's, a new
140-seat restaurant that is guaranteed to delight even the most
discriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St.
Sophia, Allred's will serve as a private club by day in the winter, an
upscale lunch spot in the summer and a fine dining experience in the
evenings year-round. More on this epicurean dream in later e-rides. For
dinner reservations, call 970-728-7474.

One other great new thing: It's easier to get to Telluride than ever
before. You can now fly to Montrose EVERY DAY from Dallas/Ft. Worth on

"
"American Airlines?but the flight will only have 129 seats, so be sure your
body is in one of them!


WHAT'S HAPPENING
Of course the most important thing on the Telluride calendar is November
22, the Official Opening Day. But there are other things worth mentioning.
Like the Sneak Preview of the mountain on November 21. For one day only you
can ski Telluride for $20, and all proceeds go to the Telluride Ski and
Snowboard Club.

After the Donation Day, you can still get good deals. From November 21
through December 16, Telluride hosts its annual Ski Free & More program.
What's it entail? Exactly what it says. Skiers and riders staying at
participating lodges in the towns of Telluride and Mountain Village can
choose a free lift ticket, a free ski clinic, a free lunch or a free
half-day of childcare for each night they stay. For more information call
888-288-7360.

And if you're looking forward to having a ball, why not do it right at the
annual Black & White Affair? On November 25, the Telluride Ski and
Snowboard Club hosts this gala event at the luxurious Telluride Conference
Center. Dress up and dance off your turkey. No one puts on a ball like
Telluride!


SLICE OF LIFE
Imagine being over 50 years old and never having seen any snow! Such was
the case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the
Caribbean. She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the
snows began to fall a few weeks ago, they were in rapture! Sarah ran
outside and began to dance around (to her 17-year-old daughter's absolute
embarrassment!) However, the daughters both caught the enthusiasm and built
their first snowman ever. The snowman , of course, had a perfect carrot
nose.. An organic carrot, no less. Hey, this is Telluride. Only the best
for our snowmen.


AND SO, E-RIDERS,
That's all for this letter. Hope you're planning your trip to Telluride,
where the snow is always whiter and the lines are always short. See you on
the slopes!

Rosemerry


WHO'S WRITING THIS ANYWAY?
Against her will, Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer learned to ski in Telluride six
years ago. But after a few turns, she fell ? in love with the sport. She
lives with her husband and cat at the base of Lift 7?an ideal spot for
getting first chair of the morning.

Hi Folks,

?

Matchups to Avoid  and Exploit.? 

Passing Game  Matchups.?? Here's how I see the matchups this  week.? Please 
note, see the  cheatsheet online?http://www.cheatsheets.net/week15sheet.htm?  
for exactly where I rank playersand to  determine who to start.? Just because 
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily 
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup.? The matchup info  is meant 
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between  
players.?? 

Note:? I,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last four 
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mike 
Hall,s excellent FLM League Management Software.? http://www.fflm.com/for 
more info.?  

Here we go:

Locks:? These games heavily favor the Offense  

Seattle Passing  Game vs Bronco Defense??  If we,ve seen one  trend recently 
in defenses it,s to start your QB / WR / TEs against the Broncos  and worry 
about your RBs.? They,re  tough on the running game but easy against the 
pass.? I won,t get into whether that,s a  &chicken or the egg8 situation but 
the bottom line is go with your passing guys  against Denver.? They rank # 31 
in  passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? QB Jon Kitna  
gets another start  and while I have a hard time putting too much faith in 
him, he,s been ok.? Derrick  Mayesand  Sean  Dawkinsshould see lots  of 
action and rookie Darrell  Jacksonis working his  way back into the mix.? If 
you,ve  been sitting on RB Shaun  Alexander, coach Mike  Holmgren did say he 
wanted to see more of Alexander in passing downs but I,m  still not too 
excited about him yet.

Tennessee Passing  Game vs Bengal Defense?? Once again, keep an eye on  QB 
Steve  McNair,shealth this  week.? It,s early, but he,s already  being called 
a game time decision as he tries to recover from knee and ankle  injuries.? 
Keep your fingers crossed  as it,s a tasty matchup vs the weak Bengal pass 
defense.? They rank # 30 in passing yards allowed  per game over the last 
month and are just playing out the season.? Cornerback Rodney Heath is lost 
for the  year with a bad shoulder and that should make things even easier.? 
Derrick  Masonis the clear cut  # 1 WR with Chris  Sanders# 2.? The best 
receiver on the team (or at  least most utilized) is TE Frank  Wycheckwho,s 
starting to  get back to his normal high level of  production.

Denver Passing  Game vs Seahawk Defense??? By now you know the  drill:? Start 
any player vs  Seattle.? Just do it.? The Seahawks are anemic.? QB Brian 
Griese did start to throw some  but he,s still at least a couple weeks away, 
maybe more.? Gus  Frerottegets another  start and if you,re looking for him 
to regain that 400+ yard form he showed  early on, this is his best chance to 
do it.? Rod Smithand  Ed  McCaffreyare the usual  must starts at WR.?  Dwayne 
 Carswelland  Desmond  Clarkare excellent  plays at TE.? I,d start either 
one  and feel pretty good about it, especially  Carswell.

Baltimore Passing  Game vs Charger Defense?? San Diego made a run back at  
respectability on defense but I,m thinking they,ve fallen back down to well  
below average.? Over the last four  weeks, they rank # 27 in passing yards 
allowed per game.? For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy  Points allowed to 
the opposing QB.?  The Ravens come back after a bye week off and should be 
ready to  roll.? QB Trent  Dilferis playing  exceptionally well and WRs 
Qadry  Ismailand  Patrick  Johnsoncould do  well.? The most enticing matchup 
may  be Shannon  Sharpeas San Diego  ranks just 24th in Fantasy Points 
allowed to the opposing TE for the  year.

St. Louis Passing  Game vs Viking Defense?? I don,t think you keep  QB Kurt  
Warnerdown for  long.? Sure, he had an awful game  last week but some of that 
can be blamed on the WRs who I bet you don,t see drop  half of what Warner 
throws this time.?  The Vikings still give up lots of passing yards ranking # 
26 in passing  yards allowed per game over the last month.? For the year, 
they rank # 24 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing QB.?  Isaac Bruce 
is the best WR  while Torry Holthas been  surprisingly disappointing lately.? 
 He,s still worth a start though.?  Az-Zahir  Hakimalways has a  chance too.? 
The Vikings just don,t  have the secondary to keep up with these  guys.

?

Prime Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense?

Buffalo  Passing Game vs Colt Defense?? I probably get more mail from my  
ripping Rob Johnson than I do for any other player.? I make no apologies as I 
really just  don,t like the guy.? He simply has  major troubles finishing a 
game.?  Although he draws a great matchup this week against Indy, one of the  
weaker defenses in the league.?  Safety Chad Cota has a concussion and is 
questionable so they might be  even less effective.? On the other  hand, the 
Colts definitely seem to up the intensity at home.? As you can see from my 
rankings, I,m not  thinking too much of Johnson again this week, but he does 
have a good  matchup.? Eric Moulds is the  primary WR as always with Peerless 
Price and Jeremy McDonald  picking up the scraps.? TE Jay  Reimersma is a 
favorite target and gets plenty of looks.?

Pittsburgh  Passing Game vs Giants Defense?? The Kordell Stewart  Bandwagon 
is getting awfully crowded lately, but for good reason.? He,s playing very 
solid football.? More importantly, he cleared a huge  hurdle Sunday showing 
some leadership and toughness coming back in the game  after injuring his 
leg.? The Giants  defense is very beatable but do understand coach Jim 
Fassell,s media games where  he says &ok8 more than Joe Pesci in Lethal 
Weapon are apparently working as his  playoff guarantee seems to have 
inspired the team.?? The pass defense still ranks # 25  in passing yards 
allowed  per game over the last month though.? For the year, they rank # 23  
in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing QB.? Hines Ward is the WR of 
choice on  this team and I,d feel fine starting him. He,s not even the true # 
2 guy, but  you could do worse then taking a reach on Bobby Shaw.? For some 
reason, I like him over starter  Courtney Hawkins. Even TE Mark Bruener is a 
solid choice as he,s  done more in the last two weeks than he,s done in two 
years.???

Kansas City  Passing Game vs Panthers Defense? I,m  dreading the Gunther 
Cunningham firing as he may make Dick Vermiel look like  Iron Mike.? A solid 
game here could  help him keep his job (which may have Chief fans pulling for 
Carolina()? From a FF perspective, I like Elvis  Grbac here.? He showed 
Monday  night he was clearly back from the finger troubles.? As usual, the 
running game is a mess but  that,s good news for Elvis owners as he,s forced 
to go with what,s been working  for them ) throwing the ball.? TE  Tony 
Gonzalez is having the incredible season we all predicted for him and  he,s 
certainly the best receiver on the team.? Derrick Alexander is a sure  
starter too.? Sylvester  Morris continues to regress which is troubling.? 
Carolina ranks just # 24 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last 
four games although for the year, they,ve  fared better ranking # 9 in 
Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing QB.? Part  of that is they seem to 
give up a lot of yards without yielding the TD so be  leery in TD only 
leagues.?

Carolina  Passing Game vs Chief Defense?? If you,ve been fence sitting with  
Steve Beuerlein, this may be a week to take a close look at him.? The Chiefs 
rank # 21 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks and 
they may be missing CB James  Hasty who,s questionable with a knee.?  WR 
Muhsin Muhammad is playing like a man possessed lately and he,s  a sure 
starter.? Donald Hayes  got through last week,s game without reinjuring his 
groin and he,s a solid  option as well.? TE Kris  Mangum is no Wesley Walls 
but he,s a pretty good player.? The Chiefs do get back home where  they,re 
tougher but I like this matchup.?

San  Francisco Passing Game vs Saints Defense??  The 49er pass defense is 
better than people think and the Saints defense  is worse than many assume.? 
Over the  last four games New Orleans ranks # 20 in passing yards allowed 
per  game.? (the 49ers  rank # 16)? In reality, both  defenses are pretty 
suspect.? And  both teams feature QBs who will be winging the ball.? Jeff 
Garcia picked up right where  he left off last week against a tough San Diego 
defense.? It was great news for Terrell  Owens fans as he looks on his way 
back.? In the meantime, Jerry Rice  showed he still has a few tricks in the 
bag.? I wouldn,t be surprised to see Tai  Streets and J.J. Stokes see 
increased time at Rice,s expense though  as many feel the Hall of Famer isn,t 
in the 49er,s plans for 2001.? RB Charlie Garner is always a threat  catching 
the ball.? TE Greg  Clark is suddenly a producer so he,s worth a shot too. 
This could be a  shootout.?

Jacksonville  Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense??  Two teams heading for the 
couch in the post season but that,s about all  they have in common.? 
Jacksonville  just ran out of time as they,re playing well now.? Arizona is 
heading downhill from an  already low position.? Arizona ranks  # 19 over the 
last four weeks in passing yards allowed per  game.? QB Mark  Brunell had an 
injury to his non throwing shoulder but appears to be  fine.? He could be a 
decent play  along with WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell.? Arizona CB 
Aneaes Williams is a player  but he can,t do it all.? The biggest  problem 
for the Jaguar passing game is talking coach Tom Coughlin into calling  
something besides a Fred Taylor run which will likely result in a 7 yard 
gain  each time(?

Minnesota  Passing Game vs Ram Defense?? You don,t need any analysis from  me 
to know you,d better start Daunte Culpepper, Cris Carter and Randy  Moss.? 
The Rams are much  improved on pass defense where over the last four weeks, 
they rank # 17  in passing yards allowed  per game.? Still  though, the 
Minnesota &Big 38 (&Big 48 counting RB Robert Smith) are no  brainers.??  

New Orleans  Passing Game vs 49er Defense?? QB Aaron Brooks  continues to be 
one of the better stories of this season.? He,s facing a 49er time that,ll be 
chock  full of youngsters although they,re playing better of late ranking # 
16  in passing yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks.? But that 
was before losing Safety Lance  Shulters to a torn ACL last week.?  Brooks 
will have Joe Horn catching the ball and Horn should  continue to shine.? 
Willie  Jackson is a solid # 2 WR and TE Andrew Glover has come alive  
lately.?  

??

Even Matchups:? These games  feature no real advantage either way?

Detroit  Passing Game vs Packer Defense?? Of course, all this hinges on the  
ribs of one Charlie Batch.?  If he can,t go, all bets are off.?  In fact, 
even if he can go, you should hedge your bets a bit as we,ve  already seen 
one good shot to the chest can mean taking a seat for Batch.? It,s not a bad 
matchup though against a  Green Bay defense that,s ranked # 22 in passing 
yards allowed per  game.? Johnnie  Morton is likely the top choice at WR with 
Herman Moore in the mix  too.? Germane Crowell may be  able to make his 
return this week as he,s been practicing this week.? I wouldn,t start him yet 
but keep an eye  out as might pay dividends for astute owners who scoop him 
up.? I can see plenty of James Stewart in  this one though as the weather 
could be really nasty for this  one.?

Chicago  Passing Game vs Patriot Defense?? This one,s full of story lines as  
a healthy Cade McNown remains on the bench this week in favor of Shane  
Matthews.? The juicy rumor here  is that according to a story in the Sun 
Times, McNown would receive a $8.25  million escalator clause if he plays in 
55% of the offensive snaps this year and  next.? He,s currently at 54%(? 
Conspiracies aside, Matthews will be  without WR Marcus Robinson who,s out 
for the year with a bulging disk in  his back.? New England ranks # 23  over 
the last four weeks in passing yards allowed per  game but the turmoil could 
take it,s toll on the Bears.? The Bears will also be without Offensive  
Coordinator Gary Crowton who took the BYU job.? Some think that will be a 
positive.?? I honestly have a hard time  getting too excited about Eddie 
Kennison and Marty  Booker.?

Dallas  Passing Game vs Redskin Defense? I,m really interested to see how 
the  team responds to new coach Terry Robiskie.?  I,ll be surprised if they 
don,t kick things up several notches.? Although I do find it odd that the 
guy  in charge of the worst performing part of the team (passing game) is the 
guy  they decided to elevate to head coach.?  Who knows?? QB Troy  Aikman 
will try to get through another game without being maimed.? He,ll have James 
McKnight and  Wayne McGarity to throw to but neither guy looks too promising 
against a  pretty tough defense.? Dallas showed  last week the complete lack 
of faith they have in Aikman when they kept feeding  Emmitt Smith the ball as 
they trailed Tampa by a mile.? David LaFluer and Jackie  Harris both are 
dropping along with Aikman.?

Philadelphia  Passing Game vs Brown Defense?? Two teams used to bringing up 
the  rear lately meet with one soaring and the other limping.? QB Donovan 
McNabb finds himself  in a strange spot here.? The Browns  are so pitiful 
against the rush that most teams choose to rush the ball on them  at the 
expense of throwing it.? But  with McNabb the team,s best rusher, he,ll have 
to decide which way he,s going to  beat the Browns.? Charles Johnson  and 
Torrance Small aren,t much.?  TE Chad Lewis is the best receiver and he could 
make some  noise.? I'm interested to see how quickly they work in newly 
signed  RB Chris Warren.

Miami  Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense??  Another good case of 
misconceptions.? Miami is better throwing the ball than  people give them 
credit for and the Bucs aren,t as dominant stopping the pass  like many 
think.? Over the last four  weeks, Tampa ranks # 14 in passing yards allowed 
per  game.? Very solid  for sure, but not dominating.?  Jay Fiedler continues 
to astound his critics as he threw for 3 TDs  Sunday.? I don,t think you,ll 
see  the same production here but he,s still a decent play.? Leslie Shepherd 
had been my  favorite WR here but with his surgery, it looks like Tony Martin 
will  finally get a start.? Oronde  Gadsden continues to make sick catches.?

?

Downside Matchups:? These games favor the  Defense

Cleveland Passing  Game vs Eagle Defense ??This is where Doug Pederson,s at:? 
He gets the start this week because  rookie Spergon Wynn can,t go due to 
injury(?? WR Kevin Johnson is running the  scout team in practice.? Against 
the  tough Eagles secondary, he likely will have trouble no matter where he 
lines  up.? I don,t look for much here from  any of these guys.

Cincinnati Passing  Game vs Titan Defense?? The Bengals just won,t die  
quietly.? Corey Dillon keeps running  the ball like a mad bull and QB Scott  
Mitchellseems intent on  proving to folks he really can play at this level.? 
He may be able to but he draws a tough  matchup Sunday in a Titan team that,s 
solid.? They rank # 11 over the last four week  in passing yards allowed per 
game.?  Although they may catch break as CB Samari Rolle is nursing a bad 
wrist  and will likely have to play with a brace.?  WR  Peter Warrickwill 
reportedly  have his contact lenses Thursday and that could make a 
difference.? He,s often worth a roll of the dice for  the start as he has the 
big play  potential.

New York Giant  Passing Game vs Steeler Defense?? The Steelers seemed to 
enjoy the  spoiler role last week against Oakland and they get another shot 
this week  against the Giants.? Pittsburgh,s  playing tough pass defense now 
as they rank # 10 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last four 
games.?  Kerry  Collinsis steady but not  exciting.? He,ll be throwing to  
WRs Amani  Toomerand  Joe  Jureviciusas it looks like  Ike Hilliard may not 
be fully ready yet this week.? Keep an eye on that one though.? TE Pete  
Mitchellhasn,t been  nearly the factor we,d thought he,d be.

Oakland Passing  Game vs Jets Defense?? The Raiders look to bounce back  this 
week and you can bet they do a better job keeping up with the down and  
distance.? The Jets are playing  tough defense of late ranking # 9 in passing 
yards allowed per game over the  last four weeks.? Still though,  QB Rich  
Gannonis a pretty much  sure starter unless you,re loaded at QB.?  Same thing 
with WR Tim  Brown.? You might roll the dice on  Andre  Risonor  James  
Jettbut Brown is the  man.? TE Ricky Dudley  is likely worth a  start just on 
potential but he,s incredibly frustrating. (like I needed to tell  the Dudley 
owners THAT()?  

Green Bay Passing  Game vs Lion Defense?? Not only must the Lions defense

I just came across a counterparty that needs to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book for all deals in Houston books.  ECC has now signed a 
Master Swap Agreement with Aquila Canada Corp., and all deals traded with ENA 
and Aquila Canada Corp. need to be settled with ECC in the P& book.  These 
deals are showing up in TAGG as settling with ENA, could you all please keep 
an eye out for deals with this company and flip them right away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Hi Jeff,

I'm hoping you're the person who takes care of this book.  If not, could
you please forward this message to the appropriate person.  There are
a few deals in the MGMT-WEST book that need to be moved to the
FT-US/CAND-ERMS BOOK.  These are all EnronOnline deals so they
were put into this book automatically.

Q24809.1
Q47957.1
Q50596.1

Could you please tell everyone down there that books deals into Houston
books, to make sure that there aren't any ECC deals with counterparties
in these books.  Nymex closes today, and I'm going to have to start invoicing
on Monday, so I need to have all deals with ECC in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS
book by the end of today.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter.

Thanks for your help
Stacey


I just looked at their sight.  They seem like a reputable company.  It's a 
store in Manhattan, NY.  The only thing to be concerned about when ordering 
by phone or online is when there is a problem with the unit.  It is more of a 
pain in the ass to mail it back than to just take it to Circuit City or Best 
Buy.  But a Sony DVD is very reliable and you should not have a problem.  I'd 
pull the trigger, that's a great price.

Darron,

I am ready to purchase the Sony C670D DVD Player.  I have gone thru CNET.com
and found a three star (highest rating) certified CNET dealer that sells it
for $340  - Tweeter has it for $449 + tax and Circuit City and Best Buy
don't carry this model.  The name of the Internet company is
moreaudiovideo.com.

Did you order yours off the internet and if so from whom?  I am a little
weary about buying something like this off the internet...

in the PRC process to have your input.  Thanks.

Kevin,

I just wanted to mention a few things.  I'm sure you are doing them already 
most of the time, but they really need to be done on each and every deal.

Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field
Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in 
Tagg
Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg
Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal
Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for 
every EOL deal
Manually rebook every EOL deal that fails - If you have trouble doing this, 
just let me know and I'll follow up.

Thanks.

DG
Instead of sending $ in and pulling $ out every month, I am going to stop 
sending $ into the CMA account starting this month.  I actually have already 
done this on the web.  What I need you to do is to stop the monthly purchase 
of APGCX for $340 begining this month.  Also, any idea if I am going to 
receive a 1099 for the recharacterization of the IRAs?  I noticed online 
that  the Roths are now zero.  Thanks.

"hit the field without star CB Bryant Westbrook, they also have to face  Brett 
 Favrein the cold  weather where he,s invincible.?  Check the weather 
conditions for this one as it could be more than just  cold.? He,s good when 
it,s freezing  outside but trying to throw the ball in a driving snowstorm is 
an entirely  different matter.? Favre will be  throwing to WR Bill Schroeder  
who I think is the  better WR choice over mega bucks Antonio  Freeman.? TE 
Bubba  Franksis always worth a  look.? RB Ahman  Greenis a nice  surprise and 
he,s catching the ball well.

New York Jets Passing  Game vs Raider Defense??  Two teams that,ll see  what 
they,re made of square off in a Sunday Night matchup.? The Raiders are tough 
against the pass  ranking # 7 in passing yards allowed per game over the last 
four weeks.? QB Vinny  Testeverdeseems to have  finally gotten himself 
untracked.?  WR Wayne Chrebetmay be handled by Charles Woodson but that 
leaves  Dedric Wardand  Windrell Hayesfor  WRs.? They,ll be fine.? FB Richie 
Andersonquietly racks up receiving totals and he could have  a good day again 
this week.?  TE Anthony Becht continues to play well and is really coming  
along.

New England  Passing Game vs Chicago Defense?? Star QBs on the bench( 
Coaches  leaving( What,s a player to think??  If you,re a defensive player 
for the Bears, you,re thinking you,d better  go out and prove some people 
wrong that think you,re finished.? Chicago plays tough pass defense ranking  
# 6 in passing yards allowed per game over the last four week.? QB Drew 
Bledsoe  will look for  WR Terry  Glennand the suddenly  red hot Troy Brown.? 
TEs Rod  Rutledgeand  Jermaine  Wigginshold down the TE  spot.? I hope 
Shockmain Davis gets a  TD as I love to write his name(?  

Indianapolis  Passing Game vs Bills Defense?? QB Peyton  Manningis still a  
starter in most leagues but you should know he,s facing a tough matchup this  
week. He struggled a bit last time these teams met with a season low 187 
yards  passing (although he did have 2 TDs)?  Marvin  Harrisonis of course 
the  clear cut # 1 Guy.? It looks like  Terrence  Wilkinsis finally  breaking 
out of his slump and could be a contributor again.? Both TEs Ken Dilgerand  
Marcus  Pollardhaven,t played up  to their potential of late.? Even  with the 
bad game last week against Miami, the Bills still rank # 5 over the  last 
four week in passing yards allowed per game.? 

??

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense

Tampa Bay Passing  Game vs Miami Defense??  Don,t start your  passing game 
guys against the Dolphins.?  CBs Sam Madison and Patrick Surtain just shut 
people down.? Especially a QB like Shaun King who,s  not 100% healthy in 
addition to being just an adequate QB.? Keyshawn Johnson is almost always 
worth  a start just for the showmanship but I,m not excited about Tampa 
throwing the  ball here.

Washington Passing  Game vs Cowboy Defense?? Brad  Johnson,sprobably taken  
his last snap as a Redskin, especially after he suggested he,d done so.? That 
means big armed  Jeff  Georgetakes the  helm.?? He,ll likely face a  Cowboy 
defense that,s tough against the pass for one simple reason:? they,re awful 
defending the run and  teams just choose to run all over them.?  Look for 
Stephen Davis  to wear it  out.? When George does throw, I  think James  
Thrashis the best  option.?  Albert  Connellwill likely start  but Thrash 
makes plenty of plays.?  TE  Stephen Alexanderis probably worth  a shot as is 
pass catching FB Larry  Centers.

San Diego Passing  Game vs Raven Defense?? Ryan Leafand company get  the 
&honor8 of facing the # 3 ranked defense over the past 4 weeks in passing  
yards allowed per game.? It should  be interesting.? Leaf will be  throwing 
to TE Freddie  Jonesand  WR Curtis  Conway.? Jeff Graham  suffered a mouth  
injury last week and may need dental surgery.? It,s probably just as well as 
this  matchup is looking very sketchy for  Leaf.
Arizona  Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense??? This could get ugly all  around.? 
Jacksonville ranks # 4 over  the last four weeks in passing yards allowed per 
game.? And Arizona,s Jake  Plummeris nursing bad ribs.? We saw with  Charlie 
Batch last week that it,s hard for a team to keep a QB in the game if  he,s 
got injured ribs.? David  Bostonis playing well lately and Frank  Sanders has 
 been awful.? I,m not excited about  any of them for this week.

** High Priority **

Subject: OU & A&M Football Game


College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31. ""The end
zones were confusing,"" says Slocum. ""I'm sure that some of the
touchdowns that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.

We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored
thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M demands a recount.""

Oklahoma officials are calling this ""outrageous"". ""They agreed to the size,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off,"" replies OU coach
Bob Stoops.  ""If they had a problem with them, they should have
said so before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy
with the outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over
thirty-five points many times.""

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well  as
that damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  ""We
are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will
be the winner of the game,"" says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones
were used. ""They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,""
says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as, ""A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!"" Students' thoughts echoed
their signs. ""All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare a
winner,"" says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.

""We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a
winner.""

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,
despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point. At about 2:30
pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC had to back off its
prediction.

College football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. ""We felt that with a
number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we were
certain A&M would carry this game. We may have been
premature in our prediction.""

is that supposed to be funny?
Hi Folks,

Keeping with the ""you know what I know"" philosophy here.

Still checking on confirmations but wanted to pass this along to you from
one of our subscribers, Greg Divers.

Greg just sent me this email:

""WSCR 1160AM in Chicago just reported that Bears' WR Marcus Robinson is done
for the year because of a bulging disk in his back.""

Thanks Greg.  While this is bad news for those hoping for a Robinson
comeback, at least it gives you a jump in the week for planning how to fill
the void.  More tonight as I hear it.

Joe

Subject: FW: Aggies Demand a Recount

College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31. ""The end 
zones were confusing,"" says Slocum. ""I'm sure that some of the touchdowns 
that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.

We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored 
thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M demands a recount.""

Oklahoma officials are calling this ""outrageous"". ""They agreed to the size, 
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off,"" replies OU coach Bob 
Stoops.  ""If they had a problem with them, they should have said so before we 
started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with the outcome.  
Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five points many times.""

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well as 
that damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  ""We 
are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner of 
the game,"" says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones 
were used. ""They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,"" 
says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearing 
signs such as, ""A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!"" Students' thoughts echoed 
their signs. ""All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare a 
winner,"" says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.

""We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a 
winner.""

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner, 
despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point. At about 2:30 
pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC had to back off its prediction.

College football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. ""We felt that with a 
number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we were 
certain A&M would carry this game. We may have been premature in our 
prediction.""

It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my 
recommendation to appoint Jeff Skilling as chief executive officer, effective 
at the time of their next board meeting on February 12, 2001.  Jeff will also 
retain his duties as president and chief operating officer.  I will continue 
as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the 
strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all 
cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth.  He is clearly ready for 
the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I,m ready for a 
somewhat different role.

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff and 
me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that 
continues to exceed everyone,s expectations, including our own.  We look 
forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role.

There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad 
shifts in strategy and direction.

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.

I think there was an AC/DC song about this guy.....

I've adopted two children for the Enron Kids Program ..

Cortesia Taylor, Kindergarden
Jameka McCoy, PreK

The total cost for both children combined is guesstimated to be $350.  If all 
of us contribute, that will be only $15 per person.  I'll be taking 
collections this week and next if anyone is interested.

Thanks,
Laura
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

TRANSACTION DEVELOPMENT
Transaction Development, headed by Rodney Malcolm, works with Pulp & Paper, 
Lumber and Steel to structure and execute some of the more complex deals.  
Members of the Transaction Development team have a strong track record of 
closing structured transactions involving both capital and commodity risks.  
Sample deals would include working on the acquisition of Garden State Paper 
earlier this year, and structuring and pitching the first all requirements, 
index based, physical steel supply contract to one of the largest players in 
the steel servicing segment of the steel industry.

The ability to buy and sell physical product will be critical to creating a 
commodity product in these businesses.  Getting access to the physical 
product will require creating compelling financing structures, as well as 
potentially buying assets to get control of their production capability.  In 
all these situations, the Transaction Development team will be a key player 
in driving these opportunities to closure.

 ""Conduct of Texas Fans at Friday's Football Game Dismays Former Student""

 November 28, 2000

 Dear Battalion and Daily Texan:

Please help me.  As a product of both Texas A&M and the University of
Texas - Austin, I thought I had learned a lot.  But I experienced some new
things at the football game this past Friday that my education had not 
prepared
me for.  No doubt there are Longhorn scholars who can set me straight.  I
watched many joyful Texas fans along with a few Aggies tailgating and
carousing.  Super.  Fall football rivalry.  Spirits were literally in
abundance.  May the better football team win.

Then I saw things that I cannot really comprehend.  I saw a Longhorn fan
with a t-shirt showing a fallen-over Bonfire.  The caption read, ""What's
wrong, Aggies? Can't keep it up?""  Can someone explain that to me?  I do
not get it.  I assure you, I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understand
evil.


"
"I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&M who were in
Corps of Cadets uniforms.  ""Little Hitlers,"" they were called.  They were 
being
spat at.  Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.  I
thought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.

I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in the
finest possible way?  - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face it
square on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, ""Heil
Hitler"" sign. 

What don't I know here?  What didn't I learn in history class?  All these
things happened before kickoff.

Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as a
thank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.  That support
obviously came from the finer Horns.  I admired the fortitude and
restraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.

Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns have
More than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.  They prefer to use their
middle finger.  Class.  Really intelligent and creative.  That will
quickly teach those ""littlest"" Longhorns how to show spirit.  I just pray they
get an honest chance to choose.

I am learning.  I have attended both schools.  I will choose the higher
ground.

If you have a scale at home, and you know what the weight limit  is, then you 
can weigh your bags at home - and if your bag is too  heavy, then you need to 
lighten your load by removing non-essential  items. -Sabrina O.

IN  LOVING MEMORY -- &WE WILL REMEMBER THEM8

An estimated 25,000  people stood in a driving rainstorm in temperatures of 
35 degrees at 2:42 a.m.  on Nov. 18, 2000. They represented Aggies everywhere 
in remembering the 12  Aggies who died and the 27 who were injured during the 
40 minute candlelight  memorial ceremony that marked the first anniversary of 
last year,s tragic  Bonfire collapse. 

In the center of the  Polo Field stood a two-tiered white platform surrounded 
by rows of maroon  chairs. The first level was lined with ""pots,"" the 
hardhats used by Aggies while  working on the Bonfire stack. The second level 
consisted of 12 maroon and white  candles surrounding a black pipe in the 
center that when lighted produced the  memorial flame. Seated around the 
platform, in 12 separate groups, were the  families of the 12 Aggies who 
died. Behind each set of seats stood a 5- to  6-foot wood pillar listing each 
victim's name and their graduation year.  

As the ceremony  commenced at exactly 2:42 a.m., lights on the polo fields 
were turned off and  the memorial flame was lighted. As the roll call was 
read over loud speakers for  each deceased Aggie, a single cannon salute 
roared into the night. Due to the  heavy rains the candles were not lighted. 
After bagpipes played &Amazing Grace,""  the ceremony ended as these words 
sounded over the loudspeakers: ""We will  remember them."" 

Of special note, as  the crowd began to disperse, a band of determined Aggies 
climbed the platform  and, in the slackening rain, lighted and then relighted 
the maroon and white  candles until suddenly for a small moment in time all 
12 burned brightly before  the rains extinguished them.

In Austin, the  University of Texas at Austin Tower was darkened in respect 
to the bonfire  victims on Friday night and remained so until Saturday 
morning. The memorial  flame was extinguished at 8 p.m. Nov 19, the time, Tim 
Kerlee Jr., the last  victim died. Then a Corps of Cadets bugler sounded 
Taps. 

Carolyn Adams, the  mother of Miranda D. Adams simply said, &I don,t know of 
any other place where  you can go out at 2:42 in the morning and see others 
in the rain paying tribute  to people they didn,t know, just because they,re 
a part of the Aggie  family.8

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/13/00 
 While completing 20 of 25 passes, Garcia threw for 244 yards with no 
interceptions, and ran for a pair of short touchdowns. In a fine performance 
against a talented Chiefs defense, Garcia showed a new dimension as a 
scrambling threat near the goal line. If defenses try to pressure him into 
making mistakes, Garcia can burn them with his legs in the red zone.   

 Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - The Klap Updated 11/13/00 
 Reaching triple digits for the first time since the 1998 playoffs, Anderson 
ran for 119 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. Don't expect too many more 
outstanding performances from Anderson this year. He is still not running at 
full throttle and may not completely look like his old self until next 
season.  

 Robert Smith , RB MIN - Eric Bass Updated 11/13/00 
 In addition to running 20 times for 111 yards, Smith caught four passes for 
53 yards, including a 33-yard touchdown. The Minnesota RB seems to be hitting 
his stride just in time for the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup 
every week.  

 Antonio Freeman , WR GB - Baja Updated 11/13/00 
 On the heels of his big game against Minnesota, Freeman was held to 36 yards 
on four catches. Most secondaries will continue to frustrate Freeman, who 
simply lacks a solid No. 2 WR across from him. Defenses won't be surrendering 
the big play to Freeman in these final games, because he is the Packers' only 
legitimate deep threat.      

 Charlie Batch , QB DET - Rocks Updated 11/12/00 
 In an uninspiring performance, Batch completed just 12 of 27 passes for 128 
yards with no touchdowns and one interception. The Atlanta defense has been 
vulnerable all year long, and Batch's struggles against the Falcons prove he 
is not a reliable Fantasy QB for these final weeks, even as a backup.     

 Charles Johnson , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 On four catches, Johnson gained just 18 yards. He was not an integral part 
of Philadelphia's 23-point day, a major outburst for such a sporadic and 
unproductive offense. Johnson shouldn't be in your starting lineup if you 
need key wins in these next few weeks.  

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/12/00 
 In an unnaccountably poor performance, Smith ran for just 16 yards on 17 
carries while losing a fumble. Such awful numbers against the defenseless 
Bengals raise major warning signs. Opponents will make Dallas beat them with 
the pass, and will be dedicated to smothering the run.      

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - The Klap Updated 11/12/00 
 The rookie back ran three times for just four yards while losing a fumble, 
and caught two passes for 18 yards. Despite a coaching change, the Cards have 
still not figured out how to properly utilize Jones, who needs more of a 
lateral, wide-open offense to succeed.      

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Rallying Seattle from a 14-point deficit, Kitna completed 22 of 33 passes, 
throwing for 231 yards and three touchdowns without an interception. It was 
eaily one of his best outings in recent memory, but Kitna seems destined to 
return to the bench once Brock Huard is healthy again. Don't expect another 
fine outing from Kitna anytime soon, because Huard is on the verge of being 
able to return.  

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks Updated 11/12/00 
 In one of his better passing displays, McNair completed 21 of 34 passes for 
228 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions, and also ran four times 
for 34 yards. If Eddie George continues to battle injuries, McNair may be 
asked to carry the Tennessee offense in the weeks ahead.   

 Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 The rookie wideout caught just one pass for four yards. Burress has been 
extremely ineffective this year, and don't be surprised if his playing time 
is cut drastically very soon.   

 Mark Brunell , QB JAC - Top Dogs Updated 11/12/00 
 Completing 24 of 33 passes, Brunell threw for 340 yards and one touchdown 
while running for a two-yard score himself. Good numbers against a bad 
Seattle pass defense. Brunell has looked better recently, but will still 
struggle against stronger opponents. Despite his good numbers, the Seahawks 
wer able to disrupt his timing on key downs.   

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 The second-year passer completed just 10 of 25 passes for 63 yards with no 
touchdowns and one interception. Those numbers look particularly awful when 
you consider Smith was facing the talent-starved Dallas defense.      

 Trent Dilfer , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Despite throwing a potentially crushing interception that was returned for a 
fourth-quarter touchdown, Dilfer led the Ravens to victory again by 
completing 23 of 36 passes for 281 yards with the one interception and two 
touchdowns. A solid performance against Tennessee is enough proof that Dilfer 
should be a servicable backup in these final weeks.      

 Leslie Shepherd , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 The veteran wideout caught just two passes for 19 yards. Poor totals against 
a soft San Diego secondary is an obvious sign that Shepherd shouldn't be in 
any Fantasy lineup this late in the year.  

 Antowain Smith , RB BUF - Baja Updated 11/12/00 
 Running 13 times, Smith picked up just 29 yards. With the running game 
sputtering, Smith is getting another chance from the Bills' braintrust, but 
it doesn't appear weeks of inactivity have improved his outlook any.  

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/12/00 
 Toomer suffered a concussion in Sunday's loss to the Rams. He did not play 
in the second half.  

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Leaf left Sunday's game against Miami in the fourth quarter with an apparent 
ankle injury. He was replaced by Jim Harbaugh. Leaf had replaced an injured 
Moses Moreno earlier in the game.  

 Trung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Reserve RB Trung Canidate left Sunday's game against the Giants in the third 
quarter after injuring his left wrist.    

 Brett Favre , QB GB - The Klap Updated 11/12/00 
 Favre left Sunday's game at Tampa Bay in the third quarter with a sprained 
left ankle. He was replaced by Matt Hasselbeck and later taken to the locker 
room on a cart.  Some published reports say Favre will miss one game, and 
maybe two.   

 Dave Moore , TE TB - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Moore left Sunday's game against Green Bay. He suffered a concussion and 
Mike Alstott lined up at TE in his place until he returned in the third 
quarter.     

 Reggie Jones , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Jones left Sunday's game against Miami with an apparent knee injury. His 
injury came shortly after QB Moses Moreno had left the game as well.   

 Moses Moreno , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Moreno left Sunday's game against Miami with a strained left knee. He was 
replaced by Ryan Leaf.   

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - The Klap Updated 11/12/00 
 Wilkins left Sunday's game against the Giants after injuring his hamstring.  
Jeff Hall will handle the placekicking duties in his absence.    

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/12/00 
 Owens is playing today against the Chiefs but did not   start. J.J. Stokes 
started in his place opposite Jerry Rice.   

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/12/00 
 Alexander left Sunday's game at san Francisco in the first half with a 
concusiion. He returned in the third quarter.   

 Obafemi Ayanbadejo , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Ayanbadejo re-injured his toe in Sunday's game against the Titans.  Sam Gash 
replaced him at fullback.    

 Thurman Thomas , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Thomas sprained his knee in the second quarter of Sunday's game against the 
Chargers.  He was carted to the locker room and will not return.  Autry 
Denson replaced Thomas as the third-down back.    

 Robert Holcombe , RB STL - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/12/00 
 Holcombe did not play in Sunday's game against the Giants.  RB James Hodgins 
started at fullback in his place.      

 Ricky Williams , RB NO - Top Dogs Updated 11/12/00 
 After rushing for 93 yards, Williams left Sunday's game in the fourth 
quarter with a broken left ankle.  He will be sidelined for six to eight 
weeks.  There have also been reports of possible ligament damage. Chad Morton 
should be the featured back in his absence. New Orleans might also use Jerald 
Moore and there is speculation they might take a look at Ki-Jana Carter.

The last I heard was that each of the Enron teams from each school would play 
each other on a weekday night or something (I had heard this Wed. for the two 
A&M teams).  Then we might have the two Enron winners play each other, with 
the winner possibly playing the Andersen winner (if they decide to play).  
That's the latest I've heard though.  Webb Jennings was supposed to be 
calling Simmons about the rescheduling.

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Rex Chapman , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Chapman announced his retirement Monday because of a series of injuries.  He 
underwent surgery on his right wrist before training camp and began the 
season on the injured list.  Chapman is also scheduled to have ankle surgery 
soon.     

 Todd Day , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Day was activated from the injured list Friday.  Guard Sam Jacobsen was 
placed on the list to make room for Day.  Day was a key reserve for the Suns 
in 1999-2000 but was sidelined for the first few weeks this season due to a 
knee injury.  He will be a valuable reserve for the T'Wolves as well but 
won't help a Fantasy team too much.     

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Skinner was placed on the injured list after hurting his ankle.  Zendon 
Hamilton was activated to replace Skinner on the roster.  Skinner has been 
somewhat of a disappointment this season averaging 5.8 points and 4.7 
rebounds per game.     

 Jeff McInnis , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 McInnis is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nets after 
suffering a bruised knee against the Sonics Saturday.  Rookie Keyon Dooling 
is expected to get his first start at point guard for the Clippers.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Williams played 26 minutes in Saturday's game against the Suns, scoring four 
points and grabbing seven rebounds.  He had missed Thursday's game against 
the Hornets because of a hip and groin injuries.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Del Negro played eight minutes in Sunday's loss to the Knicks.  He had 
missed the Warriors previous two games due to a sprained ankle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Buckner re-injured his right foot and is expected to be sidelined for at 
least a week.  Hubert Davis is expected to start at shooting guard in his 
absence.    

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Dickerson is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nuggets due 
to a sprained ankle.  Look for veteran Kevin Edwards to start at shooting 
guard in his place.    

 Doug West , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 West's strained right shoulder has healed and head coach Sidney Lowe is 
expected to activate him from the injured list this week.  Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 
is expected to be placed on the injured list to make room for West.  

 Shareef Abdur-Rahim , F VAN - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/20/00 
 Abdur-Rahim is expected to play in Monday's game against Vancouver.  He 
missed Saturday's game to be with his sick mother in Atlanta.  If he doesn't 
make it back to Vancouver in time rookie Stromile Swift could get a rare 
start at small forward.    

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 MacCulloch was placed on the injured list Monday with an ankle injury.  With 
the return of Matt Geiger, MacCulloch's already low Fantasy value diminishes 
even further.     

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/20/00 
 Geiger has been activated off the injured list, and could see some playing 
time in tonight's game in Boston.  With Geiger's return, the Sixers placed 
center Todd McCulloch on the injured list.  If you have Geiger on your 
Fantasy roster, give him some time to get back into game shape before putting 
him in your starting lineup.    

 Tim Thomas , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Thomas disclosed on Saturday that he is having some real discomfort in his 
left knee, and it is getting worse with each game that he plays. Thomas has 
started off slow, but didn't want to use the injury as an excuse.  ""It's very 
painful at times,"" said Thomas. ""The only thing I can do is keep getting rest 
as much as possible.""  The Bucks can ill-afford to lose Thomas; they have 
already lost starting forward Darvin Ham and backup forward Scott Williams 
this season.  If Thomas is on your Fantasy squad, it might be a good idea to 
keep in on the bench until his condition improves.      

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Jones has missed three straight games with a right calf sprain, but says 
that he expects to play on Wednesday night against Cleveland. Jones has 
averaged 16.9 points through his first seven games in Miami.     

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/20/00 
 Rose his hoping to make his season debut on Tuesday night against the 
Rockets, but he's not making any promises.  He was suppose to return to 
action last week, but the team's medical personnel advised him to wait a bit 
longer before hitting the court.  If Rose is on your roster, give him at 
least another week before putting him into your starting lineup.    

 Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 The Detroit Pistons announced on Monday morning that they had come to terms 
with Smith, on what is believed to be a one-year deal for the NBA's mid-level 
exception of $2.25 million (pro-rated after 11 games).  Smith had reportedly  
agreed to re-sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum 
of $611,000 last week.  He will eventually be the Pistons starting center but 
will probably spend the next few weeks inmproving his conditioning.  There is 
no need to rush and try to acquire Smith.  He has been a solid reserve 
at-best throughout his career.  If you have him on your Fantasy team wait 
awhile before you insert him into your lineup.     

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/20/00 
 Camby turned his ankle during Friday night's victory in Phoenix. X-rays 
taken on his ankle were negative, then Camby underwent an MRI as a 
precautionary measure. He missed Sunday night's game against the Warriors, 
and is listed as day to day.       

 Tim Hardaway , G MIA - The Old School Fools Updated 11/19/00 
 Hardaway, plagued by knee ailments for the past two seasons, sat out 
Saturday night's game against the Portland Trail Blazers with tendinitis in 
his right knee. Hardaway said he expects to play in Miami's next game 
Wednesday against Cleveland.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00 
 O'Neal, bothered by a sprained left ankle and a sore Achilles' tendon, was 
not in uniform Saturday night as the Los Angeles Lakers played the Denver 
Nuggets.  His status is day-to-day.  O'Neal said he was injured when someone 
fell on his leg in the first quarter of Thursday night's overtime victory at 
Sacramento. Greg Foster took O'Neal's place in the starting lineup.     

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00 
 Coleman, who missed the entire preseason because of an irregular heartbeat, 
was placed on the injured list Saturday so he can improve his conditioning.   
The move comes after Charlotte Hornets coach Paul Silas complained about the 
power forward's weight   

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Nesby made his fifth consecutive start at shooting guard for the Clippers 
Thursday.  Although he did not score in the game his defense against 
Vancouver's Michael Dickerson might have solidified him at the two-spot.  The 
switch has worked lately as the Clippers have won two games in a row.  Keep 
an eye on Nesby, if he starts scoring some points he will be a solid Fantasy 
pickup.      

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/17/00 
 McDyess appears to have overcome the back injury that stunted his production 
last week.  He scored 16 points and grabbed 11 rebounds against the Bulls 
Thursday.  McDyess is averaging 22 points and 10.6 boards in his last three 
games.  It is now safe to start McDyess again if you benched him last week.   
 

 Ruben Patterson , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Suffering from the flu, Patterson is questionable for Friday's game against 
the Mavericks.  Patterson recently rejoined the Sonics' starting lineup at 
shooting guard.  If he is unable to play Brent Barry will probably start.    

 Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 The Dallas Morning News reports that Smith has agreed to re-sign with the 
Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum of $611,000.  The deal, 
subject to league approval, could be formally announced later Friday or 
Saturday.  Smith's return to Minnesota will land him in his familiar role as 
a backup at the power forward and center positions.  His situation has 
created a lot of buzz but the truth is he is not much of a Fantasy player 
anyway.  If you already have a solid frontcourt don't try to pursue him.  If 
your Fantasy frontcourt is lacking then try to get him.  He will be a good 
addition to a Fantasy team but won't be a star.     

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Once one of the Spurs best outside shooters, Jackson has played in only one 
game this season, due in part to a lingering ankle injury.  At this point it 
would be wise to get rid of Jackson if you have him on your team and add 
another guard/forward.    

 Chris Webber , F SAC - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/17/00 
 Webber sat out Thursday's game against the Lakers due to a sprained ankle.  
Scott Pollard started at power forward in Webber's place.  Webber is listed 
as day-to-day and is expected to return for the Kings' next game on 
Wednesday.    

 Terrell Brandon , G MIN - Fear Updated 11/17/00 
 Brandon will miss his third straight game Friday when he sits out the 
T'Wolves home game against the Spurs.  Chauncey Billups will continue to 
start in his absence.  It may not be a bad idea to bench Brandon and add 
Billups to your team until he is back to full strength.     

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Williams missed Thursday's game against the Hornets due to a left groin and 
hip strain.  He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.  Shandon Anderson 
moved over to small forward in his absence and Cuttino Mobley moved into the 
starting lineup at shooting guard.  Williams remains one of the premier 
three-point shooters in the NBA connecting on 50 percent of his attempts this 
season.       

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Mills has missed Golden State's last two games because of a sore back.  He 
is questionable for Friday's game at Indiana.  When he does return he may be 
inserted into the starting lineup at small forward. Starting power forward 
Danny Fortson will be sidelined for the next few weeks due to a sore right 
foot.  Mills and Chris Mullin will be called upon to fill the void in the 
frontcourt.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Del Negro missed Wednesday's game due to an ankle injury and is doubtful for 
Friday's contest at Indiana.  Newly-acquired Randy Livingston will be the 
backup point guard in his absence.

Well,

I'm  back.  JRTC was a helluva lot better than I thought it would be.  It
was a month long, and though at times more boring then anything I have ever
experienced in my entire life, I still got to get attacked by an actual
Hind-D helicopter, Soviet BRDM's, suicide squads with backpacks stuffed with
chemical weapons and explosives that charge your tactical operations centers
(TOC) then detonate themselves.

Basically it went like this.

As soon as we got there we started preping for a Light/Heavy Combined Arms
Deliberate Attack Live Fire Exercise.  Basically what this came down to was
we had 155mm and 105mm howitzers, and 81mm mortars with more ammo then you
will ever see in an excercise. Kiowas, M1A2's Bradley's, Tow vehicles,
engineer platoon, and a dismounted platoon.  Our job was to assault through
a bunker complex to set up a support by fire (SBF) posn in order to
facilitate the main efforts assault on the Battalion's (Bn) main obj.

Basically what this boils down to is smash a path from start point to bunker
complex, smash bunker complex, continue smashing path to SBF posn. Once at
SBF posn, smash (put hellacious ammounts of steel on) the Bn  main obj for
15+ minutes to allow a notional Bn Main effort to get up to the obj,
unmolested.

Needles to say it was awesome, I will never see that many assets together,
using that much steel unless some bad guy screws up really really bad
somewhere and we go do it for real,  after experiencing this there is no way
in high holy hell I would ever want to be anywhere near the recieving end of
this hellstorm.  It was my first act out of OBC with my Company and the Live
Fire O/C thought I did well enough to warrant recieving a Division coin,

As far as the actual JRTC rotation went it was pretty boring compared to the
Live Fire.  It was four phases, 1. Entry into the Box (seizing an
airfield/foothold) 2.Low Intensity Conflict (LIC) 3. Attack on
Shugart-Gordon (MOUT stuff) 4. Defense.

The only exciting stuff came in phases 1 and 4 when we actually had heavy
contact.  4 was especially cool cause me and my guys were personally
responsible so much death and pain to enemy dismounts attempting to breach
our obstacles in order to pass their main effort of 60 armored vehicles (30
T-62's, and 30 BRDMs) that the little bastards backed up reconsolidated and
tried again (by this time our plt defending the obstacle was wiped out,)
But guess what, my Forward Observer wasn't with the Platoon but was in an OP
closer to the obstacle,  the bad guys smashed the platoons posn and thought
it was safe to try again on breachin the obstacle.  We called a mass repeat
on the obstacle (60 rounds of 155, 105 and 81mm)  needless to say they got
the hell outta there in a hurry but not without leaving a couple of smoking
vehicle hulls and a mound dead dismounts.  As a result of destroying their
breach effort we turned them back into the Brigades main Engagement Area
where the Armor guys slugged it out with them for awhile.

Anyways,  JRTC was fun,  if you like ur people, any deployment will be fun,
Louisianna was nice, a welcome change to this Island stuff,  plus the
terrain looked just like home.  In fact it was 1 and a half hours away from
your deer camp Bill, I was tempted to just pack it up and take off walkin
and just wait fer opening day.

Well this concludes my post JRTC brief, any quetions?

Mike McConnell, President and CEO of EGM, November 28 from 12 to 1 in EB 30C


Call or email Stacey Dempsey.




Planning on attending ""Scintillation"",  the Corporate Holiday Party on 
Saturday, December 9th at the Museum of Natural Science?  
Make sure you RSVP on-line at our intranet site (no www. needed) at 
holidayparty.enron.com by Tuesday, December 5th - thanks!
Dear Santa Claus:

We were good boys and girls last year, so please don't bring us a lump of 
coal again.  If you feel the need to bring us something black, the Saint 
Arnold Winter Stout will be available before Christmas.  If you take them out 
of the six pack, they will fit into our stockings, but please let us know so 
we can reinforce the hooks our stockings hang on.  Here are some other things 
on our Christmas list.  Some are events that we would like all of our friends 
to attend.

What I want for Christmas:

1. A case of Christmas Ale, but please buy it quickly because the distributor 
only has a week of inventory left right now.  That won't last until 
Christmas.  I understand that there may be a deal on it at a large warehouse 
store, but I'm not allowed to tell you where.  Do you remember the name of 
the protagonist of ""Green Eggs and Ham""?

2. All my friends to come to our Toys for Tots Bratwurst Promotion Friday, 
December 8 at the Midtown Station, 2306 Brazos, 713-522-1041.  It is from 
6pm-9pm.  Bring an unwrapped toy.  The Marines will be there (they administer 
the program) to collect the toys for the underprivileged.  Everyone should 
make a point of doing something charitable during the holiday season.  It 
will make you enjoy it even more.

3. A new St. Arnold Wants You t-shirt.  All my friends already have one.

4. All my friends to come to the 6th Annual Celtic Christmas at the Garden in 
the Heights, Sunday, December 17 from 12:00 noon - 11:00 pm.  If you bring 
this email with you, you get a $2 discount off the door price. Regular 
prices: $12.00 at the door, $8.00 advance, children 12 and under are admitted 
free. Entertainment: Seven Nations, The Flying Fish Sailors, Godfreys 
Rangers, Celtic Rebellion Dancers, The Battle of the Oak King & the Holly 
King.

5. A new St. Arnold fishing hat.  You know, the floppy canvas type with an 
embroidered St. Arnold logo on it.  It's the height of fashion.

6. A president-elect.

7. A six-pack of Amber Ale every week of the year.  

8. A (choose one) nubile young lady or strapping young buck to rub scented 
massage oil into my shoulders.

9. A warm St. Arnold sweatshirt to wear on these cold, December nights in 
case you don't bring me number 8.

10. A Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, or Jolly Kwaanza and a Happy New Year.

Love,

Saint Arnold's Army

GORE CLAIMS TO WANT EVERY VOTE COUNTED, BUT REFUSES TO STOP
DEMOCRATS TRYING TO THROW OUT LEGAL VOTES FOR BUSH

Al Gore, News Conference, CNN, 11/27/00:
""Ignoring votes means ignoring democracy itself, and if we ignore
the votes of thousands in Florida in this election, how can you or
any American have confidence that your vote will not be ignored in
a future election?""

THE TRUTH:
 ~ If Gore wants all votes counted, ought to urge dismissal of
   their case.

 ~ The voters did nothing wrong - it was the result of computer
   error.  In an effort to make sure that voters received their
   ballots, local Republicans asked the Supervisor of Elections
   if they could manually fix the misprints - suit would
   disenfranchise 15,000 voters.

 ~ Democrats are trying to throw out all 15,000 absentee votes in
   Seminole County, even though less than 5,000 of the absentee
   ballot applications required correction, just to obtain a net
   gain of votes for Gore in Seminole County.

 ~ The number was on an APPLICATION, not on a ballot.

 ~ Both parties sent out materials like this.  A computer glitch
   caused approximately 5,000 Republican absentee requests to
   contain incorrect voter registration numbers.

 ~ This has NOTHING to do with the integrity of the ballots or the
   validity of votes.

LEGAL INFORMATION

 ~ No traction for the legal claim.

 ~ State law in no way bars what took place.

 ~ Merely corrected a Voter ID Number on an application.

 ~ Control on application is voter's signature and last four digits
   of Social Security Number which must be included and is provided
   by the voter.

 ~ Voter ID Numbers are public information

FLORIDA SUPREME COURT RULES THE PALM BEACH BALLOT IS LEGAL

Florida Supreme Court Ruling:
""[W]e conclude as a matter of law that the Palm Beach County
ballot does not constitute substantial noncompliance with the
statutory requirements mandating the voiding of the election.""
 - Andre Fladell v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, 12/01/00


Gore's Legal Team Insisted The Ballot Was Illegal:

Former Secretary of State And Gore Advisor Warren Christopher:
""...there are serious and substantial irregularities resulting
from the ballot...that ballot was confusing and illegal, and that
rising out of this is the need for redress in order to make sure
that the will of the people can be properly honored...""
   - News Conference on Florida Recount, CNN, 11/09/00

GORE ASKED MIAMI MAYOR WHY MIAMI-DADE RECOUNT STOPPED

Miami Herald's Manny Garcia and Joseph Tanfani, 12/01/00:
""Hours after the Miami-Dade canvassing board called off its
recount, Gore phoned county Mayor Alex Penelas (D) asking for an
explanation.  Penelas said Gore 'asked him if 'there was anything
I could do to provide extra resources' to help the count go
forward.' Penelas also said 'Gore 'never pressured me''""

NOTABLE COLUMNS

Washington Post
COUNTING ON SOME SLIPPERY LANGUAGE
George F. Will
11/30/00

""...despite the supposed sophistication of Boies, Gore &
Lieberman, all its arguments have rested on two braided
assertions, each too weak to gain significant strength from the
braiding:

""First, anything done with a ballot constitutes a cast vote.
Second, no vote can be considered counted until a presidential
intent has been ascribed to it, even if the ascription involves
intuiting the meaning of 'marks...barely discernible to the
human eye' (the words of Judge Charles Burton, who presided over
Palm Beach County's recount).

""Beneath such result-oriented lawyers' artistry lurks a
pernicious premise. It is that casting a ballot is a task so
challenging for many voters that the task cannot be completed
without the intervention of lawyers-as-intuitors.  This soft
bigotry of low expectations infused Al Gore's eerie speech
Monday evening.""

HUNDREDS OF FELONS CAST VOTES ILLEGALLY: Since 1868, it has been
illegal for felons to cast ballots in Florida.
David Kidwell, Phil long and Geoff Dougherty
12/01/00

Excerpts:
""At least 445 Florida felons voted illegally on Nov. 7...

""The tainted votes -- found in a review of nearly half a million
votes cast in 12 Florida counties -- provide evidence that the
presidential race was influenced by thousands of ineligible
voters. Nearly six million voters in Florida's 67 counties cast
ballots.

""Nearly 75 percent of the illegal ballots discovered by The
Herald were cast by registered Democrats.

""The votes could be seized upon by the Bush campaign to argue
that a large number of illegal votes were probably cast for his
opponent, outweighing the effect of any recount.

""'It's a very powerful argument,' said Robert Jarvis, a law
professor at Nova Southeastern University.

""The Herald found 62 robbers, 56 drug dealers, 45 killers, 16
rapists and seven kidnappers who cast ballots. At least two who
voted are pictured on the state's online registry of sexual
offenders.

""Clarence Eden Williams, 77, of Pahokee, also voted. His picture
is posted on the state registry of sexual offenders for his
crimes against children. His son was surprised his father cast a
ballot.

""'He's got Alzheimer's, and he can't even carry on a
conversation anymore,' said Clarence Williams III.

""The Herald review included...8 percent of the 5.9 million votes
cast on Nov. 7. It encompassed all votes cast in Palm Beach and
Pasco counties, most votes cast in Duval County, and only
absentee votes in Miami-Dade, Broward, Lee, Leon, Hillsborough,
Clay and the Panhandle counties of Escambia, Okaloosa and Bay.

""To find felony voters, The Herald compared a list of voters in
those counties with a Department of Corrections database listing
felons who had served at least a year in prison. If the pattern
found in the study is the same statewide, more than 5,000 felons
likely cast illegal ballots.""

RealClearPolitics.com
THERE IS NO MORAL EQUIVALENCY
John McIntyre
11/30/00

For the past three weeks all we have heard from Democrats and
the media about the struggle in Florida is that ""both sides are
at fault,"" ""neither candidate has been presidential,"" and ""a pox
on both your houses."" This case for moral equivalency between
Bush and Gore is critical to the Democrats' argument. If, as the
rationale goes, both sides are to blame and the election ended
in a tie, then ""why can't we just have a compromise that affords
both sides with a 50/50 chance win the Presidency?"" This would
seem like a reasonable solution, provided those underlying
suppositions were true. The problem for Gore is that the
suppositions are not even close to being true. Both sides are not
to blame. And this election, while ridiculously close, did not
end a tie.

Vice President Gore had a right to conduct a recount of the
votes. He has had that recount of votes. When the recount upheld
the original result, that should have been the end of this
fiasco. However, even before the original recount was finished,
Gore, and his partner in crime Senator Lieberman, decided in
their minds that they really won the election. What has followed
has been their all-out assault to change what happened on
election day in Florida.

With all of the HYPE surrounding the Big 12 this season....

Nine SEC teams are going to bowls, an unprecedented number of bowl-bound 
teams from a single conference in NCAA history.




Dear St. Arnold's Army:

Ho! Ho! Ho!

This Friday, November 10 will be our 6th annual Christmas Ale Pub Crawl!  And 
for the survivors, you will be mugged.  That is, you will receive a free St. 
Arnold mug.  To qualify, all you have to do is make it to four of the stops.  
This is always a fun event, but we also have a list of suggestions for all 
participants for maximum enjoyment.  But first, where will it be?  Well, it 
cannot be preannounced to specific bars, but here is the general info: 

We will be in the Greater Rice Village Area.

We will begin at 6:00 pm.  We will gather immediately before the crawl at the 
parking lot on the south side of Bissonnet just east of Kirby, next to the 
Chevron Station.  The parking lot has a sign that says Wayland Properties (or 
something very close to that).  We will look for a bar near there to start.  
Hopefully the Bentley will be parked obviously everywhere we go.  

At 7:00, we will proceed eastward on Bissonnet.
At 8:00, we will proceed south on Morningside, turning right on Quemby.
At 9:00, we will proceed south on Kirby a block or so.
At 10:00, we will proceed further south down Kirby, then left on Rice.
At 11:00, we will proceed east on University, then take a right on 
Morningside.  For this finale, we'll do a couple of bars at once on 
Morningside.  

The Hotline numbers to try to hook up with us during the crawl are: 
713-202-4557 and 281-686-5090.  Use this if hopelessly lost.

Now, for the tips for maximum enjoyment:

1. PRECOATING: Try to eat something before commencing the crawl. 
2. PACING: Too many Christmas Ales at the first stop is a critical strategic 
mistake.  This is known as ""Sprinting Too Early"" which is not advisable in 
this, a distance event.  Can have negative repercussions later.
3. MANNERS: Be patient with bar staff.  Remember, 100 or so people just 
descended upon some poor, unsuspecting crew.  They will be working as fast as 
they can, but they won't have 10 people serving us as there will probably not 
be another mass of jubilant humanity arriving upon our departure.  This is 
also sometimes referred to as the ""Bum Rush"", but in our case, it is the 
""Saintly Rush"".
4. BUDDY SYSTEM: Make sure that you are always in contact with a couple of 
people you know.  One of you is bound to notice that the pack is starting to 
move on to the next stop.  This prevents the disoriented feeling of looking 
around an empty bar and realizing that the only three people still in there 
are guzzling some inferior malted beverage and may be related to the missing 
link.
5. MAKE NEW FRIENDS: As everyone on this crawl will be intelligent and good 
looking, this is an excellent place to meet new people.  Also, you will note 
that some people become better looking as the crawl wears on.  If this 
occurs, be sure to consult your Buddy System partner.
6. DESIGNATED DRIVER: Yes, we encourage this strongly.  You never know when 
you might decide to run for president.  And even the designated drivers on 
the crawl qualify for the mug.  While pregnant wives are perfect for this 
role, it is known to be poor judgment for a husband to claim that this is the 
best part of her being pregnant.  See ""Mood Swings.""
7. ENJOY ST. ARNOLD'S BEERS: It is in poor taste to be seen quaffing anything 
else.  Ever.  See ""Curse of Saint Arnold.""

We look forward to seeing y'all out there. Feel free to dress like Santa, St. 
Arnold or Rudolph.  Actually, not like Rudolph.  Deer season just opened.

Cheers,

Brock, David, Frank (both), James, Jamie, Jesse, Pete aka the Brew Crew!

PS:  Want to sell St. Arnold's or know someone that does?  Our distributor, 
Glazers, is hiring for a couple of positions in their beer department.  I'm 
not sure what they all are, but they are probably looking for a salesman, keg 
delivery driver and service tech/line cleaner.  Anyone who is interested 
should call Leroy Krischke at 713-578-1610 or Mike Allison at 713-795-4454.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Chris Warren , RB PHI - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 Warren arrived in Philadelphia on Friday, and practiced with the Eagles on 
Saturday. Although he hasn't had a lot of time to get familiar with the 
offensive scheme, he could get some action against Cleveland on Sunday. We 
wouldn't recommend starting him during the Fantasy playoffs this week, 
however.  

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 Although Watters didn't practice all week because of a bad case of turf toe, 
Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said he will start Sunday against Denver. Watters 
is not on the injury report and medical reports say the toe is fine.  

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 

"
" Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.

If it works for politics, it should work for sports...


NEW YORK  --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to court to 
get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World Series. The 
batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press conference 
earlier today. They were joined by members of the Major League Players Union. 

""We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers,"" said the Mets 
batting coach. ""We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we 
received and believe we have been denied our right to hit."" 

One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had 
intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls.  It was 
clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls,  though a 
much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. 

Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively 
reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in 
fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. 

""The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of  our 
right to hit,"" said the Mets batting coach. ""The World Series is not over yet 
and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely."" 

Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games 
and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game. 
""While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in fact, balls, 
there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World Series,"" the 
commissioner said. 

Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on on-base 
percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardless of the 
final scores of the games. ""It's clear that we were slightly on-base more 
often than the Yankees,"" said a Mets spokesman. ""The World Series crown is 
rightly ours."" 

The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some 
light jogging for exercise. He has stated that he believes ""we need to let 
the process run its course without a rush to judgment."" 
Don,

Sorry for the late notice, but I need to reschedule the meeting we have set 
up for tomorrow.  I can meet later in the day tomorrow or Friday afternoon at 
around 2:30 or later.

Let me know if you are available.

Thanks,

Eric,

Box Score Banter
The following question and statistical numbers come via J.C. Corrigan of 
Richmond, Va.

He asks:

""Which conference is best? Pac -0? ACC? SEC? Big 10? Big 12? Big East? Using 
the RPI, I evaluated the top eight teams in each conference (ACC is the 
smallest in terms of members, and I threw out their ""Russian judge"" team). 
If you were to add these individual team RPI up, the least sum would 
indicate the greatest depth:

Big Ten, 178; SEC, 194; Big East, 246; Big 12, 278; ACC, 369; Pac-10, 382.

Now some may argue that you should not count the bottom teams, since half 
are forced into a losing record. Others say, only one team can win, so why 
concern yourself with the bottom feeders? To refute that, here's what the 
sums look like using only the top four teams from each conference:

SEC, 40; Pac-10, 41; ACC, 48; Big Ten, 49; Big East, 66; Big 12, 69.

If indeed each conference has their bottom feeders, then we want to make 
sure there are no ""gimmies"" for those teams on top. So what's the RPI rating 
of the lowest team in each conference?

SEC, 103 (LSU); Big Ten, 135 (Northwestern); Big 12, 157 (Texas Tech); Big 
East, 167 (Virginia Tech); ACC, 168 (Clemson) Pac-10, 173 (Washington State)

Others will argue that we should include each team and then ""normalize"" 
based on the number of teams per conference. This will also account for the 
small differences between teams and reward second-tier team strength. Here 
are the conferences with their average RPI and median RPI.

SEC (39.1, 38.5), Big Ten (39.4, 29.0), Big East (45.2, 49.0), ACC (59.7, 
35.0), Big 12 (66.7, 47.0), Pac-10 (70.8, 55.0).

This data clearly shows how ""top heavy"" the ACC, Big 12 and Pac-10 are. But 
who's the best? When evaluating where each conference ranks across the these 
five categories:

SEC: 2-1-1-1-3 8

Big Ten: 1-4-2-2-1 10

Big East: 1-5-4-3-4 17

ACC: 5-3-5-4-2 19

Big 12: 4-6-3-5-4 22

Pac-10: 6-2-6-6-6 26

The SEC has a slight edge over the Big Ten, but some may say the RPI is 
biased. So how would these numbers hold up using the Sugaring Ratings?

SEC: 10

Big 10: 11

ACC: 12

Big 12: 20

Pac-10: 22

Big East: 29

Personally, I think the RPI is a little more accurate. Hope you found this 
interesting in my attempt to answer the oldest question in the NCAA book. 
Ideally, I would like to include head-to-head competition and run these 
numbers, but I'm an amateur and I don't that much time on my hands.""

Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and will 
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new 
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is 
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You,ve 
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to 
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing the 
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where 
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the 
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of 
Internet knowledge at your family,s fingertips.  

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide 
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in 
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home 
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of 
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy 
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000 
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet 
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time 
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries; 
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT, 
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal, 
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being 
employed at the time of implementation.  
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of 
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delivery 
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of 
your initial questions, we,ve posted a question-and-answer document on 
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the near 
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can 
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com. 

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your 
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new level 
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in 
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe 
Enron is a great place to work.
that bid won't be there next week :(

I am happy with my Tight End and Garner has proven less valuable than
Watters thus far this season.

Eric,

Let me know if I have Anderson or not.  If I have Morton I want to pick him
up and drop my other kicker.  If I don't have Morton do the same thing
except pick Hanson up instead of Anderson

The heat rate is going to depend on the type of fuel and the construction

 ""Conduct of Texas Fans at Friday's Football Game Dismays Former Student""

 November 28, 2000

 Dear Battalion and Daily Texan:

Please help me.  As a product of both Texas A&M and the University of
Texas - Austin, I thought I had learned a lot.  But I experienced some new
things at the football game this past Friday that my education had not 
prepared
me for.  No doubt there are Longhorn scholars who can set me straight.  I
watched many joyful Texas fans along with a few Aggies tailgating and
carousing.  Super.  Fall football rivalry.  Spirits were literally in
abundance.  May the better football team win.

Then I saw things that I cannot really comprehend.  I saw a Longhorn fan
with a t-shirt showing a fallen-over Bonfire.  The caption read, ""What's
wrong, Aggies? Can't keep it up?""  Can someone explain that to me?  I do
not get it.  I assure you, I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understand
evil.

I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&M who were in
Corps of Cadets uniforms.  ""Little Hitlers,"" they were called.  They were 
being
spat at.  Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.  I
thought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.

I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in the
finest possible way?  - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face it
square on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, ""Heil
Hitler"" sign. 

What don't I know here?  What didn't I learn in history class?  All these
things happened before kickoff.

Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as a
thank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.  That support
obviously came from the finer Horns.  I admired the fortitude and
restraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.

Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns have
More than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.  They prefer to use their
middle finger.  Class.  Really intelligent and creative.  That will
quickly teach those ""littlest"" Longhorns how to show spirit.  I just pray they
get an honest chance to choose.

I am learning.  I have attended both schools.  I will choose the higher
ground.

A Report From the 2000 World Women's Liberation Conference The
 first speaker, a lady from England stood up and said,""During last years'
conference we spoke about being more assertive with our husbands.
 Well, after the conference I went home and told my husband,
 Barrington,that I would no longer cook for him and that he would have to do
it himself!
 After the first day, I saw nothing.  After the second day, I saw
nothing.But on the third day, I saw that he had cooked a wonderful roast
lamb."" The crowd cheered.
 The second speaker, a lady from Russia stood up and said, ""After last
years'conference I went home and told my husband, Ivan, that I would no
longer do his laundry and that he would have to do it himself.
After the first day, I saw nothing.  After the second day, I saw nothing.But
on the third day, I saw that he had done not only his own washing, but my
washing as well."" The crowd again cheered.
 The third speaker, a Cajun lady from Thibodaux, Louisiana, stood
 up and said, ""Afta last years' conference, I went rat home and tole dat
lazy Coonass husband'a mine, Boudreaux, dat I wadn't gonna do no mo'a his
cookin', cleanin' or shoppin' and dat he wuz gonna have to do it all fer
hissef.""  The crowd got to their feet and roared approval.  When it became
quiet, she continued, ""And I tole'em I wadn't gonna be
doin'no mo cleanin' em nasty crawfeesh, giggin' no mo boolfrogs and water
dawgs, skinnin' none'a dem musrats and nutrias or check'n no mo
catfeesh trotlines.""
The crowd went wild - the cheering and clapping lasted for at
least five minutes. Well, the fust day,I didn't saw nuttin'.  Afta the
second day, I didn't saw nuttin'too. But afta the thud day, I could saw a
little bit outta my left eye.""



I just talked to Dad about it.  That is fine.  I should be able to get the $

touchy, touchy.  if you look at garner's stats he is very consistent (about 
15 pts. a game) - the game last week helped his cause but he has been good 
all year.
My best offer is Freeman, Garner, and Beasley for Anderson/Watters and Taylor.

Let me know

The third highest because of one Extraordinary week...  My ""Shitty""
receivers have outscored Toomer, he blows this year, I have no need for
another blow hard receiver.  Jeff George has the same value as last week..
Johnson is injury prone and one game will not make up for the last 3.  He
will falter again.

alright, when you find out that mine is the best bid for an injury prone
player that has been unable to complete an entire season in his career, you
can come back to me and maybe toomer and garner (the third highest scoring
back in the league) will still be there.

Sorry to keep bothering you, but does what we talked about earlier pertain to 
EOL trades as well given the language in those contracts, i.e. requiring

Take Allen Parkway to Shepherd.  Make a right on Shepherd and a quick left on 
Memorial.  Follow Memorial all the way to the park.  I don't know which side 
you will play on b/c both sides have fields.

Actually, I also remember that it is composed of the first three letters of

learned, I think, almost before he could spell it.  Gad,
we're getting old.

Darron,  I saw two or three software manager and an IT

something I might be interested in doing if everything
could work out.  Can we talk about Enron when you return?

Subject: requests for new curves, new books, porfolio changes

In the past few months, the procedures for setting up new curves and books 
have not been followed by everyone. 

The following memo documents the procedures to 1) set up a new curve, 2) set 
up a new book, and 3) change a portfolio hierarchy.  Please note that risk 
management (for each commodity group), ""risk management""  is responsible for 
ensuring that information is flowing appropriately between the valuation 
systems and RisktRAC (Risk Analysis and Reporting can help, but do not have 
all of the ERMS information to be able to ensure the completeness of 
RisktRAC).

I have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of 
this memo.  Please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy. 

The procedure to set up a new curve is as follows:

Trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new 
curve set up
Trader communicates this to risk management
Risk management constructs new curve in ERMS (with the help of the IT 
department)
Risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in 
RisktRAC
Curve form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up curve in RisktRAC
A system generated message is sent to people on the ""curve list"" indicating a 
change in the RisktRAC curves has been made

If the curve is not set up in RisktRAC the positions are not captured in the 
VAR or engine, thereby making VAR inaccurate.  As a side note, Risk Analysis 
and Reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new 
curves set up in ERMS are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in 
RisktRAC.  We did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in 
ERMS that are not in RisktRAC - which we are working with you to resolve.

The procedure to set up a new book in RisktRAC is as follows:

Trader/risk management determines new book is needed
New book request form (for RisktRAC) is completed by risk management
New book request form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up book in RisktRAC
Risk Analysis and Reporting forwards request to ERMS administrator and global 
counterparty group to request that book is set up in valuation and 
counterparty systems
Once all groups have completed their individual set ups, a final e-mail is 
sent to personnel on the ""books list"" and the book administrator in the risk 
management department who requested the book

It is important that there is a one to one link between the ERMS and RisktRAC 
books, or not all positions will be captured in RisktRAC (two commodities per 
ERMS book does not flow properly into RisktRAC).

The above two processes have formally existed for a number of months.  
Additionally, we are formalizing the procedure for changing portfolio 
hierarchies.  The procedure now is:

Risk management is responsible for requesting all portfolio hierarchy 
changes.  Previously, changes could be made through a request by Risk 
Analysis and Reporting or RAC.  These two groups are no longer allowed to 
submit change requests.  All requests must come through risk management.
Risk management completes a request, including the reason for the requested 
change in structure
Risk management forwards the request to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting makes the change and notifies risk management 
that the change has been made.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please call: me X39123, 
Chris Abel X33012, Burton McIntyre X57197, or Susan Trevino X31462.

Thanks,

Shona

Here is the spreadsheet we discussed in today's meeting.  It should be pretty 
straightforward.  If you have any questions, please ask.  I'll be happy to

I will look at a way to ""tie-in"" Winzip with this spreadsheet.  I don't know 
if it is possible, but if I can accomplish it, I'll let you know.

Subject: Excel file to help you out

Here is a spreadsheet I worked up to help you determine what files need to be 
cleaned up.  It is pretty simple and straightforward.  You can enter a 
directory, file extention (if you want all file types, just enter a ""*""), a 
minimum file size, and a modified before date.  The spreadsheet will perform 
a search of the directory and all subdirectories and return the files 
matching the criteria you specified.

The information is returned sorted by directory, but you can then sort by 
size, date, or whatever.

This should help you make a quick pass through your files on the ""O"" drive to 
determine some of the older/bigger ones you can clean up.

I would encourage you not to just enter ""O:\"" in the directory because the 
program will take forever, and you will run out of rows in excel to store the 
data.  Since it is in Excel, it will take just a while if you run it on a 
directory with a lot of files, so be a little patient.

I don't want to spend a lot of time supporting this thing, so if you 
distribute further, just don't tell them where you got it from (unless you 
want to designate a given person on your desk to perform the work).  

Let me know if you have questions or problems.

How about getting together for lunch or after work this week or next?


The kids and I are arriving at 9:45am on Thursday.  Because of work 
commitments, Kristi is arriving at 12:30pm.  The 3 of us will get a rental 
car and make our way to your place.  Are you going to be home then?  Then we 
will go pick up Kristi later.  We have no plans at the moment (other than 
going to the game on Saturday).  We are leaving on Sunday at an awful time,

The official social co-ordinator, Lisa,  will be unable to perform her 
obligations this evening as she is leaving on a jet plane.  As a result, I am 
taking it upon myself to conduct a poll regarding tonight's activities or 
lack thereof.  Please voice your opinions to all whether or not tonight 
should involve some sort of group outing.

So, I guess we will plan on meeting at Kenneally's on Friday after work (say 
4:30 - 5).

My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.  I don't
know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be
sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.  So, if you
want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.

Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in
the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.

Let me know

hoping for a promotion to associate, so wish me luck.

249.  Exit Greens road and go through two lights.  It will be in strip

Thanks to all of you for your generosity and support of the MS-150.  This 
year's event was another huge success, with over 8,000 riders participating 
in the 180 mile bike ride to Austin.  Enron once again had the largest team, 
breaking the national record with over 400 riders.  This year, the MS Society 
expects to set a new fundraising record of over $3 million.  With your 
support, Enron will again be the top fund-raising team with over $350,000 in 
pledges to date.  Rest assured that your money will be put to good use in 
Multiple Sclerosis research as we try to find a cure for this terrible 
disease.  

The conditions were absolutely perfect this past weekend.  The race started 
off at 7am Saturday morning from Tully Stadium in Houston.  Team Enron once 
again had the privilege of starting first in the race.  Things were going 
pretty well for me until mile 6, when another biker veered into my rear 
wheel.  Luckily, I managed not to fall and no one was hurt, but my wheel was 
completely bent.  I eventually found a support vehicle to take me to the 
first rest stop where they could do the repairs.  Unfortunately, it took me 
over 2 hours to get my bike fixed.  So much for the early start!

The rest of the day went smoothly, and I was able to make up most of the time 
I had lost in the morning by riding through the rest stops.  After lunch in 
Bellville, the roads had a few more hills, but the wind was cooperative all 
the way to LaGrange, the midway point of the race.  In LaGrange, Enron 
treated us to massages, a barbeque dinner, and cold beer, all much 
appreciated after 100 miles of riding.  The atmosphere in the camp is a lot 
of fun, with a band playing and riders filtering in all evening long with 
stories about the day's ride.  

The next morning, we got up bright and early at 5am for the MS Society's 
famous pancake breakfast.  We needed the carbohydrates because the second day 
features the infamous Bastrop State Park and its killer hills.  My legs were 
a little stiff the next morning, but after the first few miles I was warmed 
up and ready to go.  I cruised through most of the morning until Bastrop.  
For the record, the hills in the park aren't half as bad as people say.  It's 
actually one of my favorite parts of the ride because it's shaded by trees, 
and you get a lot of momentum going down the hills.  Once we were out of the 
park, lunch was only a few miles away.  I scarfed down some Subway sandwiches 
and brownies, refilled my Camelback, and was ready to go again.  Only 40 
miles left!  

After breezing through the first 20 miles, I started to wear down a little.  
At the same time, the wind picked up, so the last 20 miles were probably the 
toughest part.  When you're that close to the finish line, you have to suck 
it up and keep going.  They post mile markers the last 4 miles, and you can 
feel the anticipation building.  The last mile of the race is packed with 
people on each side cheering you on.  It's quite a rush when you get to the 
end.  Upon arriving in Austin, I checked my bike on the truck back to Houston 
and enjoyed Hooter's chicken sandwiches and pasta salad.  What a ride!

Thanks again for your support.  Just to let you know, I'll be coming around 
next week to collect your pledge.  Your contribution is, of course, fully tax 
deductible.  Enron is also doubling all pledges (the Cycling Club is taking 
care of the paperwork, so no need to fill out a form).  


Hope to see you in the race next year!

Brian

Subject: Gorons

Don't know who you're voting for, but here some things you might want to 
consider-


What is a Goron

   1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:
a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last
year.

   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobacco
when  he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies.

   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in fact
he was  placed by family influence in a ""cushy""  correspondent's job and
the only  action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)

   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt Law  educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sums
of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to ""invent the
Internet"" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially  incriminating e-mail!

   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the models for the book and movie, ""Love Story"" even though the book's
author,  Erich Segal, says not.

   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.

   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton ""one of
the greatest Presidents of our history.""

   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
ineffective  that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH of
Tennessee's  Senators!

   11.  Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum  house that he was renting to them.

   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons are
generally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to
actually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from their
ailment, since it may be  harmful to their well-being, yours, mine and
that of the USA.

   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out to
aid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,  PLEASE, pass this on to
your normal  friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.

 WAKE UP AMER  A, THIS IS WHY OUR
 FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND
 AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION

Where We're Headed
    By Robert A. Waters
****************************************************************

 You're sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your
 bedroom door.

 Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled
 whispers. At least two people have broken into your house
 and are moving your way.

 With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed
 and pick up your shotgun. You rack a shell into the
 chamber, then inch toward the door and open it.

 In the darkness, you make out two shadows. One holds a
 weapon--it looks like a crowbar.

 When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the
 shotgun and fire. The blast knocks both thugs to the floor.
 One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to
 the front door and lurches outside.

 As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're
 in trouble. In your country, most guns were outlawed years
 before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently
 regulated as to make them useless.
 Yours was never registered.

 Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died.
 They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal
 Possession of a Firearm.

 When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry:
 authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter.
 ""What kind of sentence will I get?"" you ask.
 ""Only ten-to-twelve years,"" he replies, as if that's nothing.
 ""Behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven.""

 The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local
 newspaper. Somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric
 vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir
 boys. Their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say
 about them. Buried deep down in the article, authorities
 acknowledge that both ""victims"" have been arrested numerous
 times. But the next day's headline says it all:
 ""Lovable Rogue Son Didn't Deserve to Die."" The thieves have
 been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type
 pranksters.

 As the days wear on, the story takes wings. The national media
 picks it up, then the international media.

 The surviving burglar has become a folk hero. Your attorney
 says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win.

 The media publishes reports that your home has been
 burglarized several times in the past and that you've been
 critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the
 suspects. After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you
 would be prepared next time. The District Attorney uses this to
 allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.

 A few months later, you go to trial. The charges haven't been
 reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted. When
 you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works
 against you. Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean,
 vengeful man.

 It doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.

 The judge sentences you to life in prison.

__________________________________________

 This case really happened.

***********************************
 On August 22, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk, England,
 killed one burglar and wounded a second. In April, 2000, he was
 convicted and is now serving a life term.

 How did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the
 once-great British Empire?

 It started with the Pistols Act of 1903. This seemingly
 reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and
 established that handgun sales were to be made only to those
 who had a license. The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing
 to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns.
 Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of
 any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of
 all shotguns.

 Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after
 the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987. Michael Ryan, a
 mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down
 the streets shooting everyone he saw. When the smoke cleared,
 17 people were dead.

 The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of ""gun
 control"", demanded even tougher restrictions. (The seizure of all
 privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan
 used a rifle.)

 Nine years later, at Dunblane, Scotland, Thomas Hamilton used
 a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at
 a public school.

 For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as
 mentally unstable, or worse, criminals. Now the press had a real
 kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners. Day after day,
 week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and
 demanded a total ban on all handguns.
 The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the
 few sidearms still owned by private citizens.

 During the years in which the British government incrementally
 took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right
 to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism. Authorities
 refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened,
 claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to
 own a gun. Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were
 charged while the real criminals were released. Indeed, after the
 Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, ""We
 cannot have people take the law into their own hands.""

 All of Martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and
 several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young
 thugs who had no fear of the consequences. Martin himself, a
 collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or
 stolen by burglars.

 When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns
 were given three months to turn them over to local authorities.
 Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law. The few
 who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year
 prison sentences if they didn't comply.

 Police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 200,000 handguns
 from private citizens.

 How did the authorities know who had handguns?

 The guns had been registered and licensed. Kinda like cars.

 Sound familiar?

 FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND

Since the Product Type description is ""US Gas Basis"", it is implied that the 
swap is against last day NYMEX and some othe MONTHYL CONTRACT PRICE, which is 
why we specify GD/D, so the viewer knows its a NYMEX last day vs. Gas Daily 
Average price. Take a look at the Indexes used in the other Basis swaps that 
are out there and you'll see what I mean.
I'm a little concerned about the request for Agua Dulce and Carthage. If 
memory serves me, Elsa tried to push these through earlier and it was 
determined that gas at these delivery points was interruptable. Interruptable

Dale,

On the new Gas Daily product that you are setting up, I think it would be a 
good idea to have a Nymex reference in the short description.  Something 
like, US Gas Daily NX GD/D HSC. 


In addtion, we need two new index locations set up, Carthage hub and Agua 
Dulce hub.  Please contact Todd Richardson for further details on these.

Thanks for your help.







Dolores,

I have signed up for the CFA exam in June.  Who do I need to talk to to get a 
reimbursement?


Thanks,

Eric
What do you want for him - I am willing to talk something with M. Robinson in 
it

Something like Westbrook and Taylor for Robinson and Garner?

Happy St. Patrick's Day!
I'm moving this weekend to another apartment in the same complex.  We're
overlooking the pool now, so stop by and visit.  I've attached the new
address.  Phone numbers will remain the same.

Things here in Houston are going well.  I'm going to Eastern Europe March
29-April 11.  The tentative schedule is Budapest, Prague, Munich, Salzberg,
Vienna, and Marseille.  The weekend after I get back is the MS-150 bike ride

from Houston to Austin, so wish me luck!


Hope all's well,
Brian

Hello everyone -

This Friday some of my friends and I (and Michael of course) are getting
together to celebrate my birthday.  We're starting with dinner at Lupe
Tortilla at 8:30 pm and then most likely going to the Mercury Room.  We
might go to a few other places depending on who wants to do what.  I'm
pretty leniant as long as I get to dance!

I hope you all can make it.

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian

Redskins to stick with Johnson at quarterback 
 Sept. 19, 2000
By Len Pasquarelli
SportsLine.com Senior Writer
 



Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter 
interceptions by Brad Johnson, the Washington Redskins will stick with their 
starting quarterback for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants, 
SportsLine.com has confirmed. 

""If it was just (a problem) with Brad, then we'd look at it, but that's not 
the case,"" coach Norv Turner said. ""But it goes beyond just the quarterback 
position. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general."" 

   
Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the 
unbeaten Giants.(AP)   

In the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday 
night, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for 
the key matchup against the undefeated Giants. The Washington offense, one of 
the league's most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No. 2 overall and second in 
scoring, has been sporadic at best in three games. 

A seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson 
has five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth 
quarters of those losses. He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or 
his execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that 
it might be time for a change. 

One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to 
throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries. The Redskins have 
only three completions this year of more than 20 yards, and the longest is 26 
yards. In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to 
tailback Stephen Davis. 

The Redskins, who averaged 12.7 yards per completion in 1999 with both 
starting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic 9.2 
yards per catch this season. 

But Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at 
this point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new 
focus more than a new starter. 

""There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks),"" he said. ""Right 
now, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere 
else.""

Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 09/19/00
Sepculation is increasing that George may get a chance to start after Brad
Johnson struggled against Dallas. The rifle-armed QB may put a jolt into the
Washington offense if he indeed gets a chance to start.

:)

Please forward to the owner of Brad Johnson.

Elizabeth:

Darin Giron called me about the EOL park and loan deal from Friday. These 
deals will cause differences with your EOL-Sitara reconciliation. The EOL 
deal will error out in Spreadsheet - Natural Gas, therefore you won't see it 
erroring out under Sitara. The EOL Park and Loan deal should be booked as 
four deals in Sitara. These Park and Loan deals should be booked as two 
exchange deals (one receipt and one delivery) between ENA and the third 
party. And then two desk to desk deals between ENA and EMW. The EOL deal 
number should be referenced on both of the exchange deals. Darin booked EOL 
deal 330098 as two physical forwards (348347 and 348364) and two desk to 
desks (348362 and 348375). He is going to create the two exchange deals and 
kill the two physical forwards and reference the EOL deals numbers on the 
exchange deals. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey Darron,

What's going on??  Just wanted to say thanks for inviting me to go out on
the boat last weekend.  Hope I was not rude when we were leaving, but I
really started to feel like crap.  When we got back to Scott's I almost
puked a couple times and was stuck on the crapper for some time.  I ended up
not going to work on Monday and half of Tuesday because of the hebee jebees.
Anyway, if you ever need anyone to help you with the boat when you go out
(uh, yeah), give me a call and I would be glad to 'help' out.

No, I sent the email to you by mistake.  We will be at Sheri's tomorrow.  How 
do you know her?  Is it through Dawn?  When Sheri sent the message to 
everyone, I noticed your name on the list and called to ask, but you didn't

A?game, and in future OU games? 
	?? Joe Rushing 
	
	 BROWN:  Mack Brown and his staff are not an in-your-face group of coaches. 
Players say that they are treated with respect. Make no mistake, they know 
their jobs are on the line every day in practice. They know if they don't 
perform in practice, they will be replaced. But SS Greg Brown said that Mack 
Brown has never given a ""hell hath no fury"" locker room talk, before, during 
or after a game. Greg Brown said that Mack simply states what's on the line 
for each game and expects the players to find their own way to motivate 
themselves. Mack has said that as well. He said he asks players what works 
for them best: whether it be the tough-love approach or the straightforward 
approach. He has said constant yelling wears off. So he doesn't play head 
games with his team. According to coaches and players from his time as OU 
offensive coordinator back in 1984, Mack used to be a much more in-your-face 
kind of coach, yelling at players to get them going. Coach Barry Switzer had 
to tone him down. Brown said he has learned that you can't be negative with 
players, that you have to treat them with respect. I don't know that you will 
hear him talk about hating other teams. 
	?
	
	
	 Q: Looking at the haul of recruits Texas already has commitments from, is 
there an area of need not being addressed? It appears that this is quite a 
haul of offensive linemen, so it looks like a lot of redshirts in the making. 
If he signs, what will Quan Cosby be asked to do? Doesn't he have a twin 
brother - and is that a factor on where he signs? When all is said and done, 
where do you think this class will rank come signing day in February and 
which of the potential signees, not orally committed, will most determine 
where that rank ends up? Also, with Sneezy Beltran coming off a redshirt year 
and from what I am reading, an impressive one at that, what do you see in the 
future for Cedric Benson? What about the returning RBs such as Ivan Williams, 
Kenny Hayter, et al? Is the abundance of talent at RB a good thing or too 
much of a good thing? And one last thing: Is anyone looking to transfer after 
the season? 
	?? Roy Cassas 
	
	 BROWN:  Quarterbacks and linemen (on both sides of the ball) control the 
game, so you can never have enough of those positions. UT is filling its 
needs nicely with the commitments that it has. The player that can probably 
make the biggest difference is Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, perhaps the 
best defensive tackle in the country. UT's class is shaping up as a top 10 
nationally, again. If Harris comes, it will climb. But as is the case with 
all of this recruiting hype, it's just that - hype. Who knows if Cedric 
Benson will play next year? He has to come down here in the heat of August 
and prove to the coaches that he's better than Kenny Hayter, Ivan Williams, 
Victor Ike and Sneezy Beltran. I would say Benson's chances are good if some 
of those guys don't toughen up and let loose. But time will tell. As far as 
guys looking to transfer, there aren't any rumblings yet. Stay tuned. 
	?

	UT's road uniforms  
	
	Q: I can say this because I am a graduate of the University of Texas: I think 
the Longhorn football team has the UGLIEST uniform in all of college 
football. When the Horns play on the road, they have too much white and not 
enough color. They wear the ugliest black football shoes and those long solid 
white socks are atrocious. It looks like each player can dress anyway he 
desires, there is no uniformity in the look. Some players don't even wear 
socks at all. It seems  
	
	the coaches let each player express their own individuality, and I think they 
play like a bunch of individuals instead of as a team. Coach McWilliams let 
this trend start and it has continued through the current regime with poor 
results. The orange home jerseys are not the right color orange, and they 
look cheap. I wish Coach Brown would adopt a true burnt orange color. I wish 
he would change the helmets to the same burnt orange color with a white 
traditional Longhorn logo on each side and a white facemask. Shirttails 
should be tucked in and each player should be dressed the same. Few 
indicators of individuality should be allowed. The Longhorns look ragtag and 
slow on the field. If they would improve their image, their play might 
improve as well.  
	 ?? John Robert Pharr, Waco, Texas 
	
	 BROWN:  That seemed to be more of a comment than a question. But everyone is 
entitled to their own opinion. I don't know about the burnt orange helmets. 
That might be a little too much of a good thing. 
	?
	
	
	 Q: Do you think that the loss to OU will hurt our recruiting class? I know 
that we tend to compete for the same players and that they had their recruits 
at the Cotton Bowl (since they were the home team).  
	?? T. Franks, Austin  
	
	 BROWN:  It appears that Oklahoma is making some serious inroads on UT 
recruiting territory, at least for the 10 or so recruits the Longhorns still 
hope to get orally committed. Namely, Tommie Harris, the defensive tackle out 
of Killeen Ellison. Texas needs to take care of business on Friday to keep 
the Sooners from stepping up their pitch for some of the noncommitted kids UT 
is hoping to sign. 
	?
	
	
	 Q: The lack of respect Texas is getting leading up to the A?game is 
disturbing. I understand that the Horns were crushed against OU and also had 
an early-season loss against Stanford on the road, but even with the stats 
from those two losses, the Horns have one of the nation's top 5 defensive 
units, plus we are playing at home and are riding the confidence of five 
consecutive wins. 
	 ?? Derrick Jackson, Coppell, Texas 
	
	 BROWN:  Well, Texas is a 5-1/2 point favorite, so I don't know where the 
lack of respect comes from. But I think people are lukewarm about UT because 
the Longhorns haven't had a chance to show how much they've improved against 
a quality opponent - until now. The Longhorns need to go out and grind the 
Aggies into the ground to get the nation's attention. And I think they will. 
I'm predicting Texas 31, A?21. 
	?
	
	
	
	
	
	
	[IMAGE] 
	Quentin Jammer  
	
	Q: What are the key matchups in Friday's game? 
	?? Lucas Harrington 
	
	 BROWN:  In think the best matchups will be MLB De'Andre Lewis against A&M's 
corps of running backs, namely Ja'Mar Toombs. Also keep an eye on Quentin 
Jammer against A?WR Robert Ferguson. Lewis basically said this week that if 
you hit Toombs in the mouth, he'll fold. So that immediately inspires some 
interest in that matchup. Jammer also had a lot to say about Ferguson, 
stating that if  
	
	Ferguson's ankle wasn't 100 percent, it might not even be a close matchup. 
""If he's 50 percent or 75 percent, that won't cut it,"" Jammer said. Jammer 
did say that he thought a healthy Ferguson was better than Kansas State WR 
Quincy Morgan. Jammer and Ferguson are both big, roughly 6-1 and 205 pounds. 
Should be fun to watch. 
	?
	
	
	 Q: Is Texas A?a legitimate passing team after all these years of trying to 
air out the ball and not being able to? 
	?? Stephen Torrence 
	
	 BROWN:  I think so. It seems hard to believe. After Branndon Stewart and all 
the hype about building a big-time passing offense the past several years, 
it's finally hit College Station. The Aggies run four-wide, even five-wide. 
They have trick plays, and Robert Ferguson, Bethel Johnson and Chris Taylor 
are big-time receivers. And 25-year-old QB Mark Farris is the gritty leader 
and 60 percent passer they have been looking for. I think it will be a decent 
test for Texas, owner of the nation's No. 1-ranked pass efficiency defense. 
	?
	
	 Q: Why does Texas keep throwing that out pattern and allowing Chris Simms to 
be intercepted for touchdowns? 
	?? Margie Phillips 
	
	 BROWN:  I'll let Mack Brown answer that one: ""It's not the same pass or we 
would throw it out of the playbook. We're not that dumb."" That was his 
comment Tuesday night on his radio show. 
	?
	
	
	 Q: Do you think Chris Simms is ready for the pressure of the Texas A?game? 
	?? Deginald Franks 
	
	 BROWN:  I think so. Simms seemed to grow in confidence after the Kansas 
game. Getting the chance to pull the Longhorns out of a 14-0 hole after 
throwing a pick for a TD really seemed to give him a positive jolt. Normally, 
he would have been pulled at that point for Major Applewhite - at least he 
would have been pulled early in the season (a la Louisiana-Lafayette). So 
getting the chance to play an entire game seemed to help. I believe Simms 
will be fine on Friday. He must feel good about his deep ball to Roy Williams 
after the success they had at Kansas. I would expect to see a lot more of 
that, creating room for Hodges Mitchell to run against a depleted A?front 
seven.  
	?
	
	
	 Q: I heard that this is only the ninth time that Texas and Texas A?are both 
ranked coming into this game. That doesn't seem right. 
	?? Brock Marshal 
	
	 BROWN:  It doesn't seem right, but it is. Of the 107 times these two teams 
have met (including this year), both have been ranked only nine times. Those 
years are 2000, 1999, 1995, 1985, 1977, 1975, 1974, 1943 and 1941.

Norv Turner Fired   From the article:
http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/ce/multi/0,1329,3141082_59,00.html   Washington
Redskins coach Norv Turner was fired Monday after failing to live up to
Super Bowl expectations with the most expensive team in NFL history.  Turner
was dismissed by owner Dan Snyder one day after a 9-7 loss to the New York
Giants. It was the fourth loss in five games for the Redskins (7-6) and
third in a row at home, and it moved a team with championship aspirations
precariously close to elimination from the playoff race.
Passing game coordinator Terry Robiskie was named interim coach. He
immediately began holding team meetings for Sunday's game in Dallas.
Turner fought back tears as he said goodbye.
""I've obviously been put in a good position to have an opportunity to win,""
Turner said. ""This team has a chance to be 10-6. That's a disappointment to
me. There's part of me that would like to be a part of it. There's part of
me that understands why it's necessary to make a change right now.""
Turner, 48, earned a reputation as a master strategist with the Dallas
Cowboys, where he was the offensive coordinator for two Super Bowl teams in
the early 1990s. Some of his game plans in Washington were truly masterful,
but his lack of communication skills and inability to keep players focused
and motivated led to his downfall.
Injuries also slowed the offense. Three starters were lost for the season
and several others played hurt.
The reconstituted offensive line had its worst day Sunday. However, there
were also many unforced errors such as dropped balls, missed blocks and bad
snaps.
Robiskie, 46, becomes the NFL's third black head coach. He is a former
offensive coordinator with the Oakland Raiders and was one of Turner's first
hires in Washington in 1994. He is known for a tough-love coaching style
from his dealings with temperamental Redskins receivers Michael Westbrook
and Albert Connell.
""He might add a little more fire to it,"" Connell said.
The Redskins also announced Franklin Pepper Rodgers would become vice
president of football operations and tight ends coach Pat Flaherty would
replace LeCharls McDaniel as special teams coach.
Rodgers, a former head coach at Kansas, UCLA and Georgia Tech and at Memphis
of the USFL, will head the team's selection process for a new head coach in
2001.
//////////

My View:  If I'm Turner, I'm happy to be out from under Danny Snyder.
That's all I have to say about that.  From a FF perspective, I wouldn't be
surprised to see the team show an uptick in intensity behind Robiskie.  We
saw it in Arizona and Cincinnati but the difference here will the be the
Redskins have the talent to turn that enthusiasm into productivity on the
field.  In other news, it looks like QB Jeff George gets another start this
weekend after replacing Brad Johnson.  Turner had been Johnson's protecting
saint so the QB move coinciding with the coaching change is not surprising.

See you tonight in our upgrades and downgrades.

youngster was up to, he asked in his friendliest way,
""What are you up to, Nancy?""

Hi Folks,
?
Careening toward the week 11 games as we try to  keep you on top of all the 
latest happenings.
?
Before we jump to this week's Updated Players in  the News, I wanted to let 
you know we've updated the Target  numbers.? Understanding how many times a 
player has been thrown to  (targeted) can offer a much better picture of how 
an offense is truly  distrubiting the workload.? You can find the WR targets 
here http://www.cheatsheets.net/wrtargets.htm?and  the TE numbers here 
http://www.cheatsheets.net/tetargets.htm??  Enjoy.

News galore....let's jump into  it


Quarterbacks in the News:

QB Chris Chandler (Atl)  is doubtful with a concussion. He has not practiced 
all week. QB Danny  Kanell will start in his place.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is  expected to sit another week with a sore shoulder. 
Doug Flutie gets the start  again.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) still cannot throw and will  not play this week. Jim 
Miller starts in his absence.

QB Doug  Pederson (Cle) will start this week, but the coaches may give him 
the  quick hook should he struggle.

QB Troy Aikman (Dal)  practiced with the first team Thursday and is expected 
to start this  week. If he cannot go because of his back, Cliff Stoerner 
would start. Randall  Cunningham is also hurt with a sore knee and has not 
practiced.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Troy Aikman  (Dal)? Coach Dave Campo says he'll wait 
until Sunday to declare a  starter for this week's game.? We expect it to be 
Aikman, but given this  uncertainty, I'd look elsewhere for a QB.
?
QB Brian Griese (Den) continues to  play through his ailments. This week will 
be no different.

QB  Charlie Batch (Det) has recovered from his concussion and is expected  to 
start this week.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) is  expected to play with a sore elbow. Hint to team, 
Maybe try throwing for less  than 500 yards?

QB Daunte Culpepper (Min) does not  appear on the injury report, but has a 
sore knee. He is expected to start this  week.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) was seen wearing a splint and  did not practice on 
Wednesday. The team is being very mum whether he will play  or not. John 
Friesz would get the start in his absence, but the team could also  use 
Michael Bishop if Friesz struggles. This is likely a situation you should  
avoid if at all possible.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Drew Bledsoe (NE)  continues to draw conflicting 
information. Some say he's looking a  little more likely to start Sunday.? 
Others say the team is sandbagging and  he'll miss a couple of weeks.? Even 
if he does start, you'd have to think  thumb would be a problem.? I'd look 
elsewhere if you can.

QB  Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) still has a stiff neck, but has played through  it 
the last two weeks. Expect the same this week.

QB Kordell  Stewart (Pit) gets the start this week.

QB Jim Harbaugh  (SD) is listed as questionable, but he will not start. The 
team named  Moses Moreno the starter earlier in the week.

QB Brock Huard  (Sea) is not fully over his concussion. He is expected to sit 
this  week. Jon Kitna will get the start.

QB Kurt Warner (StL)  is out for another 2-3 weeks.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Kurt Warner  (StL)? St. Louis Post Dispatch is 
reporting Warner will have the  pins removed from his finger Tuesday.? 
Remember early on that Warner said  he'd return one day after the pins were 
removed.? Most feel that's way too  optimistic but expect to hear a lot about 
this soon.

QB Shaun  King (TB) has tonsilitis, but is expected to play on Sunday. He  
practiced on Thursday. 

QB Steve McNair (Ten) will  likely be added today to the injury report with a 
sore back. He expects to play  on Sunday though.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is on a bye this  week and will not play.

QB Jeff George (Was) is on a bye  this week and will not  play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Running Backs  in the News:

RB Bob Christian (Atl) is questionable with a sore  knee. He did not practice 
on Thursday.

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo  (Bal) is listed as questionable with a sore toe.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Obafemi  Ayanbadejo (Bal) will likely play although 
Sam Gash will be the  starter.? Keep an eye on Ayandbadejo as he quietly had 
some very productive  weeks early in the season.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf)  returned to practice and will play this week.

RB  Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) rested Wednesday, but is expected to play  
with his sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Tshimanga  Biakabutuka's (Car) outlook has dimmed?a 
little as he was  downgraded to Questionable.? He wasn't able to practice any 
this week and  looks to be a gametime decision now.? If he can't go, Brad 
Hoover will  start at Tailback.? Yes, that would be the undrafted Fullback 
Brad  Hoover...

RB Brandon Bennett (Cin) is healthy enough to  play this weekend. He will 
backup Corey Dillon.

RB Jamel White  (Cle) is expected to cut into Travis Prentice's carries this  
week.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal) is expected to play with a  sore ankle.

RB Howard Griffith (Den) was able to  practice and will play this week.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB)  is likely out for the rest of the year. Ahman Green 
will start in his  absence.

RB Shyrone Stith (Jac) missed Wednesday's  practice, but heexpects to play if 
needed.


"
"RB Ricky Williams (NO)  is expected to play with his sore shoulder.

RB Joe  Montgomery (NYG) is listed as questionable and did not practice  
Wednesday. With Thunder and lightning healthy, he will likely be rested to 
get  healthier.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) is fine, but the Jets  continue to list 100 players on 
the injury report. He will start on  Sunday.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) has two sprained ankles  and was held out of 
practice on Wednesday. He played through the pain last week,  but looks as if 
he is in worse shape this week. He will likely be a game-time  decision which 
is ugly since he plays on Monday Night. We will keep you posted  regarding 
any breaking news regarding his status.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Tyrone  Wheatley (Oak) was unable to practice 
Saturday according to ESPN's John  Clayton.? He could still play Monday as 
he's clearly shown he can play  through pain.? I'm very leery though.? If I 
had another comprable  back, I'd go there this week.

RB Amp Lee (Phi) is  expected to play with a sore back.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala  (Pit) is out for the next three weeks.

RB Jerome Bettis  (Pit) skipped Wednesday's practice, but isexpected to start 
on  Sunday.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) skipped Wednesday's  practice, but ishopeful of 
playing on Sunday.

RB Fred Beasley  (SF) is doubtful with a sprained ankle. He has not  
practiced.

RB Marshall Faulk (StL) is out for another 3  weeks.

*** Saturday Update? RB Trung Canidate  (StL) is rumored to be making his 
first appearance this week.?  I'll be interested to see how he affects 
Watson's playing time.

RB Robert Holcombe (StL) has a  sore hamstring, but expects to play. He is 
listed as questionable on the injury  report.

RB Eddie George (Ten) is banged up with a sore  knee and toe. But look for 
the iron-man to suit and play on Sunday.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Eddie George (Ten)  went through the Saturday walk 
through today and looks to start.?  

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will use the bye week to heal  his sprained wrist.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is on a bye  this week and will not  play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Wide  Receivers in the News:

WR David Boston (Ari) has a sore  hamstring, but is expected to play. 

WR Tim Dwight (Atl)  will be downgraded to questionable on Friday's injury 
report. He has  sore ribs and could be a game-time decision.

WR Travis Taylor  (Bal) was placed on injured reserve and is lost for the  
year.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Patrick  Johnson (Bal) gets another start with Taylor 
gone.?  

WR Kevin Drake was signed by Buffalo.

WR  Muhsin Muhammad (Car) is expected to play with his sore  hamstring.

WR David Patten (Cle) has not practiced and  is doubtful this week.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle)  practiced on Wednesday despite being listed as 
questionable with a sore  knee.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Darrin Chiaverini  (Cle) will miss Sunday's game.

WR Raghib Ismail (Dal)  has a torn ACL and is lost for the year.

WR Chris Cole  (Den) is expected to play with a sore elbow.

WR Germane  Crowell (Det) will not play this week. He is recovering from a 
broken  foot.

WR Desmond Howard (Det) missed Wednesday's  practice, but isexpected to play 
this week.

WR Corey Bradford  (GB) is back on the injury report with a quad strain. He 
has not  practiced and is doubtful for this week.

WR Terrence Wilkins  (Ind) was criticized heavily by the coach to the media 
this week. Coach  Mora has stated that E.G. Green will see more playing time 
this  week.

WR Marvin Harrison (Ind) has practiced with his  stiff neck and will play 
this week.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)  used the bye week to get healthier. He is expected to 
play this  week.

WR Tony Martin (Mia)  is expected to play this week with a sore foot. He will 
not start  though. Oronde Gadsden and Leslie Shepherd will be the  starters.

WR Terry Glenn (NE) signed a six year contract  extension. ""She"" should be 
there for many years to come.

WR Jake  Reed (NO) is out with a broken fibula.

WR Ron Dixon  (NYG) did not practice Wednesday and will likely be rested to 
get  healthier.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ) is expected to play  with his sore shoulder.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) is expected  to play with his sore back.

WR Laveranues Coles (NYJ)  will also return kickoffs after the team cut Kevin 
Williams.  

WR Charles Johnson (Phi) is expected to play with a  sore shoulder.

WR Sean Dawkins (Sea) was held out of  practice Wednesday and Thursday with a 
sore quadricep. He is listed as  questionable on the injury report.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Sean Dawkins (Sea)  practiced Friday and looks like 
he'll play at least  some.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) missed Wednesday's and  Thursday'spractices with a very 
tender toe. He's listed as questionable and  could be
a game-time decision. Tai Streets and JJ Stokes will see extra  action if 
Owens can not go.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Terrell Owens  (SF) took part in about 70% of 
Friday's practice.? Coach Steve  Mariucci is reportedly leaning towards not 
starting Owens Sunday although it  seems likely he'll play at least some.? 
The amount he could play will be  determined by how Owens feels at gametime.? 
This is so tough to call as  he's one of the elite WRs in the game and 50% of 
Terrell Owens is better than  100% of lots of other WRs.? People always want 
numbers so here's my  opinion:? 
Chances he doesn't play at all:?  25%
Chances he plays but contributes less than his  normal numbers: 50%
Chances he plays and looks like the Owens we've  been seeing: 25%
Weigh that out for what it's worth and make the  call that best suits your 
team and situation.? He's a high risk, high  reward decision this week.? If 
you're pretty well set and just need a few  points out of your WR slot, I'd 
probably bench him and find another guy.?  If you need to swing for the 
fences, I'd probably be inclined to gamble on him  and keep your fingers 
crossed.? 

WR Derrick Mason (Ten) is the  least hurt of all the receivers and will start 
on Sunday. He is battling a sore  back and ankle. He practiced on Thursday.

WR Chris Sanders (Ten)  is listed as questionable on the injury report, but 
expects to start  with his sore back and ribs. He practiced on Thursday.

WR Yancey  Thigpen (Ten) shockingly appears on the injury report as 
questionable  this week. For those that have followed his career, this 
usually means he will  not play. 
?
***Saturday Update? WR Yancey Thigpen  (Ten) surprised us and put together 3 
solid days of practice at the end  of the week.? Coach Fisher was even 
talking about the Titans taking some  shots downfield and Thigpen figuring 
into the gameplan.? We've heard this  before so be careful.? 

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) is  still bothered by a hamstring and was not able to 
practice at full speed. He is  not likely to make much of an impact this week.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Carl Pickens (Ten)  is inactive for this week.

Congratulations Election Integrity 2000 Users. In just
over 24 hours we have collected 100,000 signed letters
to Al Gore urging him to concede. But let's not stop
there!

We need to put more pressure on Al Gore. Below is an
e-mail that can forwarded to all of your friends and
relatives -- anyone who is interested in preserving
the integrity of this election.

Spread the Word!

============================================================

Dear Friend,

Al Gore is flatly refusing to accept the fair and just
election results.  Instead, he is pursuing a calculated
course of action intended to overturn the will of the voters
and the CERTIFIED election results.  Included in these
actions are his attempts to attack and discredit military
absentee votes cast for George W. Bush while simultaneously
using manipulative ""hand-counting"" techniques to convert
so-called ""dimpled chads"" into votes for Gore.

This is not fair, it is not right, and the American people
won't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent by
Al Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf.

What Gore is doing is WRONG.  And every day that he continues
to contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or in
the media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers
an overwhelming majority of American citizens.

In order to make this point clear to Mr. Gore, Election
Integrity 2000 is collecting online letters to send to Al
Gore urging him to concede the election NOW!

Please go to http://www.electionintegrity.com/home/g349.cfm
 to sign your letter to Al Gore right now.

Al Gore always claims to be ""listening to the will of the
people.""  The fact is, WE are the people, and he is about to
hear from us in a big way.

PLEASE forward this urgent e-mail to every friend who might
be interested in sending a message to Al Gore that America
wants him to concede.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

1
STATEMENT FROM SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER III

The American people voted on November 7.  Governor George W.
Bush won 31 states with a total of 271 electoral votes.  The
vote in Florida was very close, but when it was counted,
Governor Bush was the winner.

Now, three days later, the vote in Florida has been recounted.
Over two-thirds of the state election supervisors overseeing
the recount are Democrats.

At the end of this recount, Governor Bush is still the winner,
subject only to counting the overseas ballots, which have
traditionally favored the Republican candidate.  No evidence of
vote fraud either in the original vote or in the recount has
been presented.

Now the Gore campaign is calling for yet another recount in
selective and predominantly Democratic counties where there
were unexplained large vote swings in their favor in the
recount.

It appears that the Gore campaign is attempting to unduly
prolong the country's national Presidential election through
endless challenges to the results of the vote here in Florida.

Furthermore, the more often ballots are recounted, especially
by hand, the more likely it is that human errors, like lost
ballots, and other risks, will be introduced.  This frustrates
the very reason why we have moved from hand counting to
machine counting.

Let me say a word specifically about the Palm Beach ballot.
There is a rule of law to be followed for elections.  The state
of Florida has established legal procedures to design, approve,
publish and, if need be, to protest ballots before the election.
The ballot was designed by a Democratic elections supervisor.
She approved it.  The Democratic Party did not question it
before the election.  This ""butterfly""-type ballot was used in
recent elections in the same county under the same rules.  Again,
the Democrats did not complain.  The overwhelming majority of
voters who used the ballot understood it and cast valid votes.
Our lawyers have confirmed the legality of this ballot, and we
have copies of the relevant Florida statute available for you
to see.

The Gore campaign has also tried to make a lot of the fact that
double marked ballots are not counted.  A key principle in
America is one person, one vote.  If we have ballots with two
votes, of course we cannot count them or guess about them.
Ballots that are double-marked can't be evidence of the voter's
intent to vote one way or another.  No jurisdiction in the
United States would accept such a ballot as a valid vote, and
Florida law specifically does not.  It happens in every
precinct in every election.  And the procedure is clear:  These
ballots must be disregarded.

We understand, and I understand personally, that it is
frustrating to lose by a narrow margin.  But it happens.  It
happened to the Republican Presidential candidates in 1960 and
1976.  Both Vice President Nixon and President Ford put the
country's interest first.  They accepted the vote for the good
of the country.

It is important that there be some finality to the election
process.  What if we insisted on recounts in other states that
are very close?  For example, in Wisconsin, Iowa, (and if we
don't win) New Mexico.

Let the country step back a moment, pause, and think about
what's at stake.  This may be the last chance.  There is no
reasonable end to this process if it slips away.

The purpose of our national election is to establish a
""Constitutional government,"" not unending legal wrangling.  We
will therefore vigorously oppose the Gore campaign's efforts to
keep recounting until it likes the result.  For the good of the
country and the sake of our standing in the world, the
campaigning should end, and the business of an orderly
transition should begin.

_________________________________________________________________

STATEMENT FROM BUSH COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR KAREN HUGHES:

""The vote count on Tuesday night showed Governor Bush won
Florida's election, and a recount has now confirmed his victory.
The only votes left to be counted are the overseas absentee
ballots, which in the past have favored Republican candidates.
Bob Dole carried the overseas ballots in Florida in 1996 by a
margin of 54 to 40 percent, even though he lost the election in
Florida.  We hope Vice President Gore and his campaign will
reconsider their threats of lawsuits or still more recounts,
which could undermine the constitutional process of selecting a
President and has no foreseeable end.""

DEMOCRATS URGE GORE TO QUIT LEGAL WRANGLING

""Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, questioned the
Gore campaign's wisdom in challenging the Palm Beach result.
The right thing, Mr. Breaux said, 'is to count the votes and
respect the decision,' without lengthy litigation. And Senator
Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, warned against
getting mired in the courts...

""'I want Al Gore to win the election,' Mr. Torricelli told
reporters, 'but more than that, I want somebody to win this
election. There is going to have to be a very compelling case
for anybody to take this into a court of law.'""
- The New York Times' R. W. Apple, Jr., 11/10/00

_________________________________________________________________

NEW YORK TIMES, WASHINGTON POST, OTHERS: REVOTE OR COURT REMEDY
POLITICALLY UNSOUND AND LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE

""The problem is that potential remedies, such as a new election
in Palm Beach County, seem politically unsound and legally
questionable. The sad reality is that ballot disputes and
imperfections are a feature of every election. It will poison
the political atmosphere if presidential elections, in
particular, come to be seen as merely a starting point for
litigation.""
- New York Times, Editorial, 11/10/00
http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/10/opinion/10FRI1.html


""We say yes to counting a little more, but the legal action
about which Mr. Daley spoke elliptically should be approached
with enormous caution and restraint. Absent more than is
currently known, our sense is that either a lawsuit or a repeat
vote would raise at least as many questions as it would likely
resolve; the courts in the end can't legitimize the results.""
- Washington Post, Editorial, 11/10/00
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57302-2000Nov9.html


""Some folks are even calling for a rerun of the Florida
election.  It is important to decide this election by the rules
that 100 million Americans understood -- or should have
understood -- when they entered the voting booth Tuesday.  This
is not just about fair play for Al Gore and George W. Bush. It
is about defending a system that regards voting-day verdicts as
the final word, a concept that distinguishes this nation from
most others in the world.""
- San Francisco Chronicle, Editorial, 11/9/00


""'You know, I don't think the ballot was a problem, Bill and
I'll tell you why-is that there's one section I don't know if
people are really looking at, which relates to electronic or
electromechanical voting.  And in that particular case, what
the law says down here, it says 'Voting squares may be placed
in front of or in back of the names of candidates and
statements.'""
- CNN's ""Crossfire,"" Greta Van Susteren,  11/09/00


""If you start saying the ballot should be thrown out because
of confusion, I think that cases like that could be brought all
over the country.""
- CNN's Larry King Live, Bill Schneider, 11/8/00

A guy brings his girlfriend back to her home after being out on a date.
They reach the
front door, he leans with one hand on the wall, looks into her eyes and
says, ""Sweetie,
why don't you give me a blow job?""
""What? You're crazy!"" she replies.
""Don't worry, it will be quick, no problem!""
""No!! Someone may see; a relative, a neighbor...""
""At this time of the night, no one will show up,"" he adds.
""I've already said NO, so NO!""
""Honey, it's just a small blowie, I know you'll like it too!""
""NO!!! I've said NO!!!""
""My love, don't be like that, come on!""
At this moment the girls sister shows up at the door in her nightgown
with her hair totally
in disorder, rubbing her eyes and says, ""Dad says either You have to
blow him, I have to
blow him, or He will come down and give him a blow job himself, but for
God's sake, tell
your boyfriend to take his hand off the intercom!""

DEFERRAL ENROLLMENT 2001--ADDED VALUE FOR YOUR FUTURE
? 

Rushing Game Matchups???  Here's how I see the matchups  this week.? Please 
note, see  thecheatsheet online?http://www.cheatsheets.net/week14sheet.htm?  
for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.? Just because 
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily 
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup.? The matchup info  is meant 
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between  
players.????

Locks:? These games heavily  favor the Offense??

Jamal Anderson (Atl) vs Seahawk  Defense?  If you,ve learned  anything this 
season, it,s start RBs facing the Seahawk defense.? Fo the year, they rank # 
26 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.?  Over the last four weeks, 
they,ve really tailed off ranking # 31 in  rushing yards allowed per game.?  
They,re playing for pride and look for Anderson to make a  statement.



Warrick Dunn (TB) vs Cowboy  Defense?? The Cowboys haven,t gotten any  better 
against the rush this year as they still bring up the rear.? Over the last 
four weeks, they rank # 30  in rushing yards allowed per game.?  For the 
year, they,re ranked # 30 in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing RBs.? 
Dunn,s athletic style  will give them trouble much like Charlie Garner did 
earlier the season.???

Fred Taylor (Jac) vs Brown  Defense?? Cleveland struggles against most  any 
RB but especially tough, physical rushing teams.? Taylor and the Jaguars fit 
that  bill.? This season has seen some  rushing performances of historical 
significance this year.? You might see another one this  week.? On paper, it,
s a dream  matchup.???

Tyrone Wheatley (Oak)  vs Steeler Defense?? I know it,s hard to believe but  
the numbers show that over the past four weeks, Pittsburgh ranks # 28 in 
rushing  yards allowed per game.? They,re  allowing 171 yards rushing on the 
ground.?  Granted, Fred Taylor, Eddie George and Corey Dillon figure into 
that  number but a healthy Tyrone Wheatley isn,t too far down below their 
class.? He,s healthier now than he has been in a  while.



Ricky Watters (Sea) vs Falcon  Defense?? I,ve been a Ricky Watters fan  since 
the 49er days.? One of the  best combinations of rushing and receiving in 
some time.? He,s had an age defying season and the  roll should continue 

"
"against a Falcon unit that,s been awful defending the run  lately.? For the 
last four weeks,  they rank # 27 in rushing yards allowed per game.? For the 
year, they,re # 28 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.??  Everyone 
keeps wondering  when Shaun Alexander will see time but unless Seattle gets 
blown out here (which  I have hard time seeing) I think you,ll see plenty of 
Ricky  Watters.?

Corey Dillon (Cin) vs  Cardinal Defense?? Like Fred Taylor vs. Cleveland,  
this one looks almost too good to be true on paper.? They don,t always turn 
out that way in  reality but you,ve got to be drooling over this game if you,
re a Dillon  owner.? His running in the lack of a  real passing game threat 
is an amazing feat.? Hopefully for him Scott Mitchell can be  effective 
throwing the ball which will help even more.

?

?

Prime  Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense??

Tony  Richardson / Kimble Anders (KC)? vs  Patriot Defense??  Our support of 
Christian Okoye  last week for a Chief RB didn,t garner much support from the 
KC coaching staff  so it looks like another week of Richardson / Anders.? 
Anders actually got plenty of carries  last week and promptly did very little 
with them. Richardson appears to be the  better back right now but who knows 
how this will play out.? It,s hard for me to advocate  either.? But if you do 
go with one,  know that they,ll be facing a pretty soft New England rush 
defense that ranks #  25 in rushing yards allowed per gameover the  last four 
weeks.?

Tshimanga Biakabutuka / Brad Hoover (Car) vs Rams  Defense??? Biakabutuka 
found there was  no rehabilitation method quite as effective as 60,000 folks 
chanting  &Hoooooo-ver8 on Monday night(?  Amazing how that consistently 
works.? Biakabutuka has been upgraded to  probable but I,m not convinced 
Hoover just takes his place back on the  bench.? You,ll likely see both  go.? 
The Rams still give up a good  bit of yardage on the ground lately averaging 
127 yards per game over the last  four weeks.? That ranks them #  24.? For 
the year, they rank # 23  in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  RB.???

J.R.  Redmond (NE) vs Chief Defense?? The Patriots are a tough team to  
figure and coach Bill Belichick is starting to remind me of Captain Queeg  
rolling the marbles while his crew forms a mutiny.? But if he can hold them 
together, I,ve  got to think Redmond has a pretty good matchup here.? The 
Chiefs rank # 23 over the past four  weeks in rushing yards allowed per game.
? For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  RB.
?  Keep  an eye on QB Drew Bledsoe as if he can,t go, all bets are off but if 
he can keep  the defense honest, I like Redmond,s chances here.? Of course, 
you have to know the risks  that Belichick could decide to go with Patrick 
Pass or Kevin Faulk at a moments  notice if Redmond looks at him the wrong  
way(



Edgerrin James (Ind) vs  Jets Defense?? The NFL is the ultimate game of  
watching to see what others do.? You  can bet the Colts are aware of the 
success Chicago,s James Allen had last week  rushing (and fumbling) the ball 
against New York.? I think you,ll see a steady diet of  Edgerrin doing the 
same thing (hopefully not fumbling though)? James is a no brainer ) start 
him  against virtually any team unless you,re so loaded at RB it,s not  
fair.?

Eddie George (Ten) vs  Eagle Defense?? Philadelphia isn,t quite as tough  vs 
the run as their reputation might have you believe.? Over the last four 
weeks, they rank # 21  in rushing yards allowed  per game.? For the  year, 
they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.? But you  can 
pretty much throw those numbers out when it,s Eddie George.? He,ll get his 
yards the hard way.? I,d be very surprised if you don,t see  George exhibit 
some leadership here and put together a solid  effort.



Curtis Martin (NYJ) vs Colts  Defense?? It sounds like Curtis Martin is  just 
going to have to play with the strained buttocks.? (you,ve heard enough jokes 
by now, I,ll  spare you)? The Indy defense is  definitely vulnerable to the 
rush.?  For the season, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points allowed to the 
opposing  RBs.? This game will be in New York  and the Colts are soft when it,
s cold outside so Martin could have an  edge.?

James Allen (Chi) vs Green  Bay?? Let,s give Allen the benefit of  the doubt 
and say the THREE fumbles Sunday were rain induced.? (although I didn,t see 
Curtis Martin  fumble three times and he was there too()?  If he can find the 
handle on the ball, he,ll be fine as he actually ran  very while when he 
managed to hang on to the football.? Green Bay proved Monday night they can,
t  stop much of anything and this could be a nice opportunity for the Bears 
and for  Allen.

??

Even Matchups:? These games feature no real advantage  either way?

Travis Prentice / Jamel White (Cle) vs  Jaguar Defense??  This is one of  
those games that may not play in reality the way it looks on paper.? 
Jacksonville has yielded an average of  120 yards rushing per game over the 
last four weeks.? That ranks them # 20.? They also rank # 20 for the year in  
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs.? But they,re playing better than 
that now  I believe.? And the Browns are just  playing out the season.? And 
the  bigger issue is Travis Prentice is fighting for playing time as Jamel 
White has  looked impressive.? It,s a decent  matchup for Cleveland but I,d 
probably shy from these guys if it were  me.?

Michael Pittman (Ari) vs Bengal  Defense?? A case of both sides being better  
than what many people think.?  Michael Pittman is a player.?  Since Vince 
Tobin left, it,s been pretty much Pittman,s show on the  ground much to the 
chagrin of Thomas Jones owners.? And on the other side of the ball, the  
Bengals are a better defense than they get credit for.? On the ground, they 
rank # 17 in rushing  yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? For 
the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.?  So 
this once could truly go either way.? I,d feel ok with Pittman if he was my  
guy but I wouldn,t be overly excited.?

Robert Smith (Min) vs Lion  Defense?? This isn,t the best matchup in the  
world for Smith but you have to start him.?  If nothing else than to get an 
early lead on your opponent with a  Thursday night game.? C,mon, that,s  
worth something(? Seriously, Smith  is one of the elite RBs right now but 
Detroit is playing pretty tough against  the run ranking # 15 in rushing 
yards allowed per game over the last four  weeks.? He,s a starter though, 
just  play him.?

Ahman Green (GB) vs Bear  Defense?? Find a nice toasty place to watch  this 
one.? Chicago in December.? At night.? That,s football.? With Dorsey Levens 
likely gone for the  year, the Packers are looking to Green to be the Man.? 
Chicago has a tough run defense led by  all world rookie Brian Urlacher.? I  
told you this Summer my cab driver in Chicago was calling him &Vanilla 
Freak8  and now you,re seeing why.? I love  this kid.? These guys are  
professionals but I can promise you Green thinks about the hard hitting guy 
with  the wild eyes lined up across the way from him as the temperature 
keeps  dropping.???

Lamar Smith (Mia) vs Bills  Defense? Smith practiced Wednesday and while it,
s  awful early to make a definitive call, it looks like he,ll start Sunday.? 
The Bufallo defense is solid against the  rush.? They rank # 13 in rushing  
yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? Although for the year, they 
rank # 5 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.?  Although if Smith 
can return to his awesome form before the injury, he,ll  be a load.? The 
Dolphins will rely  on the running game with Jay Fiedler likely rusty plus 
not that good to begin  with.?

Marshall Faulk (StL) vs Panther  Defense?? Let,s hope Faulk gets back to his  
old form.? And let,s hope the  Panther defense gets back more their old 
rushing defense form.? Over the last four games, Carolina ranks  # 12 in 
rushing yards allowed per game.?  But for the year, they come in at # 25 in 
Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing RB.? It sounds to me like  coach Mike 
Martz won,t make the mistake again of underutilizing one of his best  weapons 
in Faulk.

??

Downside Matchups:? These  games favor the Defense?

Shawn Bryson / Sammy Morris / Antowain  Smith (Buf) vs Miami Defense?? 
Believe it or not, the Dolphin  Defense ranks just # 16 in rushing yards 
allowed per game over the last four  weeks.? Granted, 3 of those games  don,t 
factor MLB Zach Thomas but that number is still higher than I would have  
thought.? The Bills rushing game is  a mess.? The team is calling Morris,  
ankle questionable so we,ll have to wait and see.? Bryson has done very 
little with the  opportunity and we know Smith didn,t produce or we would 
have never seen so much  of Bryson and Morris.? With a  healthy Zach Thomas, 
I,d probably shy a bit from any of these guys.????

Emmitt Smith (Dal) vs Buccaneer  Defense?? Emmitt Smith said he,d never been  
knocked out in his career but that,s what happened Thursday.? He,s bounced 
back quickly and says he,ll  certainly be the starter Sunday.?  The Bucs are 
tough but not invincible.? Over the last four weeks, they rank # 11  in 
rushing yards allowed per game giving up 95 yards per game on the  ground.? 
Emmitt,s made a living  running the ball against tough defenses over his 
career so I,m not overly  concerned with the matchup.? He,s a  gamer and I,d 
say he,s probably a starter for most owners this week even facing  Tampa Bay.



Stephen Davis (Was) vs Giants  Defense??  Be very leery  here.? Stephen Davis 
demonstrated  last week that you have to take what he says with a grain of 
salt.? Players are notoriously optimistic about  their chances for recovering 
from injury.?  Unless I could turn my lineup in very late this week and I was 
sure he,d  start, I,d think very hard about going elsewhere this week.? It,s 
not like he,s facing Seattle and  this is a dream matchup or something.?  The 
Giants are tough against the run ranking # 2 for the year in Fantasy  Points 
allowed to the opposing RB. ?So unless you know for sure he,s going,  I,d 
strongly consider my other options.?

Terrell Fletcher (SD) vs 49er  Defense?? Fletcher is probable with a rib  
fracture which must sound worse than it is.? Either that or he,s one tough 
guy.? The problem is that San Francisco is  playing much improved defense 
lately.?  Against the rush over the last four weeks, they rank # 9 in rushing 
yards  allowed per game.? That,s a marked  contrast to their year long 
numbers where they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.? 
Adding  Fletcher,s ribs to the improved Defense, I don,t see much from San 
Diego on the  ground Sunday.?

Ron Dayne / Tiki Barber (NYG) vs  Redskins??  To me, Barber is  looking much 
more favorable in this game simply based on the opinion I don,t see  New York 
taking a lead where they can grind out the clock.? If you,re a Dayne owner, 
you,re  painfully aware that coach Jim Fassel puts Dayne on the shelf in 
favor of Barber  when his team trails.? The Giants  are a good team but I don,
t see them jumping all over Washington.? Plus, the Redskins play very good 
rush  defense.? For the year, they rank #  4 in Fantasy Points allowed to the 
opposing RB and over the last four weeks,  they rank # 8 in rushing yards 
allowed per game.???

James Stewart (Det) vs Viking  Defense?? Stewart,s great game against Tampa  
Bay taught me not to discount him too much based on matchups but he,s got a  
surprisingly tough situation here.?  Minnesota over the last four weeks ranks 
# 7 in rushing yards allowed per  game.? For the year, they rank # 14  in 
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.? Part of that has to do with the 
Vikings  explosive offense which throws team into passing mode to catch up 
but part of it  is that the Vikings are just improved there.? LB Dwayne Rudd 
should miss the game with  a bad shoulder so that favors Detroit but I,m 
still not overly excited about the  matchup.? Still though, Stewart is  one 
of the better backs and I,d think he,s likely a starter for your team unless  
you,re loaded with RBs.

??

?

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense?

Darnell  Autry / Stanley Pritchett (Phi) vs Titan Defense??  The Eagle RBs 
have been very little factor and I don,t see them all of a  sudden emerging 
against a very tough Tennessee defense.? Especially one in a foul mood after  
another last second loss from the kicker.?  It,s a tough job, but QB Donovan 
McNabb carries this team almost solely  on his shoulders.? He could be the  
teams leading rusher again as Tennessee puts the clamps on the RBs.? For the 
year, the Titans rank # 6  in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.???

Mike Anderson (Den) vs Saints  Defense?? I like Mike Anderson and he,s a  
great story but he,s got a very tough matchup this week with New Orleans.? 
The Saints rank # 3 for the year in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing 
RB and over the last four games, they  rank # 5 in rushing yards allowed per 
game.? They,ve just averaged 81 yards per game  allowed rushing.? Anderson is 
still  probably worth a start unless you,re really deep at RB but just be 
aware he,s  facing a tough defense.?

Charlie Garner (SF) vs Charger  Defense?? With a week off to prepare, Garner  
comes back to face a rejuvenated Charger team coming off their first  
victory.? They,re playing rush  defense like we,re accustomed to seeing from 
San Diego ranking # 4 in rushing  yards allowed per game over the last four 
weeks.? Garner isn,t your normal back but he,s  facing a tough game here.? I,
d still  start him as he,s got that big play potential with the ability to go 
the  distance at any time, but I,m not excited about the  matchup.?

Jerome Bettis (Pit) vs Raider  Defense?? Jerome Bettis was built for  
grinding down defenses in the December cold but he,ll have a tough matchup 
this  week against Oakland.? The Raiders  rank # 2 over the last four weeks 
in rushing yards allowed per game.? That,s partly why their passing defense  
is so bad: teams can,t run so they go to the air.? I like Bettis and I think 
he,ll be able  to grind out some yards at home but this is clearly a 
difficult matchup  here.?

Jerald Moore / Chad Morton (NO) vs  Bronco Defense?? Assuming Moore is ok 
with his neck  stinger, he,ll be running behind his outstanding OL but this 
is a tough matchup  against the Denver Defense that,s remained tough vs the 
run.? Over the last four weeks, they rank # 3  in rushing yards allowed per 
game allowing an average of 74 yards per game.? Ricky Watters and Seattle 
only managed  to post 85 against them Sunday.?  Moore looks to get the 
majority of carries and goalline work so he,s the  better option at this 
point assuming he can go.? But even healthy, he,s got his work cut  out for 
him.

Hi Folks,

Again this week our own Cheatsheets.net Meteorologist, Mike McVay from
WOWK - TV offers his expert insights on the weather conditions that may
affect your players this week.  It's early but here are some potential
situations to keep an eye on.

WASHINGTON @ PITTSBURGH:  Saturday will bring a chance of snow to
Pittsburgh.  Both teams will likely run the ball any way, but the weather
could reinforce the ground game in this one.

NEW ENGLAND @ BUFFALO:  A chance for snow showers in Buffalo this weekend.
No surprise here.  Both teams adapt to these conditions so I don't expect
any changes in offensive schemes, but Vinatieri and Christie might not be
great options in this one.

DETROIT @ NEW YORK JETS:  Rain changing to snow in New York Sunday.  Looks
kind of messy but this is a must win for both teams.  Should be a fun game
to watch, but frustrating if you have fantasy players on either team.

TENNESSEE @ CLEVELAND:  Much like Buffalo, you can generally expect snow in
Cleveland this time of the year....and the Browns last game of 2000 will be
no exception.  Wind could be a factor in this game if you have either Del
Greco or Kevin Johnson (he's not used to passing in these kind of
conditions).

One other note to think about is the terrible condition of Paul Brown Field
in Cincinnati where the Bengals host Jacksonville this week.  Thanks to my
friend John Pflum for the insights as he tells me the transplanted grass has
basically died and between the hashmarks is a total mess.  Could especially
be a factor for the kickers.  Just a thought.

See you Thursday morning with our cheatsheet rankings and Friday morning
with the Matchups to Avoid and Exploit.

BLEDSOE NOW APPEARS  READY TO START VS. CHIEFS...

According to reports out of Foxboro, New England  Patriots quarterback Drew 
Bledsoe took his regular  turn at practice for the second day in a row Friday 
and all  indications are the veteran signal caller will start and play as  
usual against the Chiefs Monday night. 

Of course, that hardly means Bledsoe is  100 percent healthy; he's anything 
but. And whether it's jammed,  bruised, sprained, fractured, broken or just 
plain old sore, the  real problem is trying to figure out just how badly the 
thumb on his  throwing hand is injured and how much it affects his ability 
to  throw the ball. 

Not surprisingly, head coach Bill  Belichick says Bledsoe is no worse off 
than he's been the  previous three weeks. 

""This is the 13th week of the season.  There will be a lot of players out 
there on both teams who will be  less than 100 percent, and (Chiefs 
quarterback  Elvis) Grbac is one of them,"" said  Belichick. ""Same thing with 
our quarterback. That's football in the  13th week of the season."" 

Bledsoe came out of the chute strong in  Detroit on Thanksgiving day, but 
regressed as the game progressed,  throwing two crucial fourth-quarter 
interceptions that kept the team  from mounting a realistic comeback... And 
even though Bledsoe  continues to insist the thumb isn't affecting his 
throws, you'd be  hard-pressed to find any evidence backing that contention. 

The bottom line here says a lack quality  depth at the key offensive skill 
positions around him make it very  difficult to rely on Bledsoe for 
consistent production... 

Other items of interest... 

Michael Felger of  the Boston Herald noted earlier this week that with  the 
weather sure to be an issue and Bledsoe at less-than-full speed,  coaches 
would love come out and run the ball on the Chiefs. The  question is whether 
injury-prone J.R. Redmond will  be up to the task. If not, look for Belichick 
to spread the load  between Redmond and fellow rookie Patrick Pass.  

Reserve tight end Chris  Eitzmann (ribs) was placed on injured reserve for 
the  season, leaving the Pats with one roster spot to fill... Starting  wide 
out Troy Brown (leg) was the only player not  to fully participate at 
practice and his availability is likely to  be determined by a dreaded game 
day decision.

MITCHELL REMAINS ON  TRACK TO RETURN AS BENGALS' STARTER...

Cincinnati Enquirer reporter  Tom Groeschen wrote this morning that Bengals 
head coach  Dick LeBeau characterized Scott Mitchell as  ""probable"" to start 
at quarterback when his team takes on the Cardinals  tomorrow. 

Mitchell missed last week's game against Pittsburgh  because of a sprained 
left knee. This week, his mobility was better as he took  60 percent of the 
practice snaps and Akili Smith took 40  percent. 

&I think probable's a good word,8 LeBeau said. &We're  gonna see how Scott's 
knee responds, but he looks better every day.8 

Mitchell took the majority of snaps at Friday's  practice. 

&I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be able to  go,8 he said. 

LeBeau said Mitchell probably won't need a Sunday  morning test, as he did 
last week before the Pittsburgh game. 


"
"&I don't think that will be necessary, unless some  complications develop 
between today's workout and Sunday,8 LeBeau said. 

According to those who follow the team closely, the  Bengals would like to 
use the team's remaining games to evaluate Mitchell before  attempting to 
re-sign to the veteran signal caller to compete with third-year  man-to-be 
Smith for the starting QB job next season. 

Team president Mike Brown made the  statements after watching Mitchell 
participate in his first practice in 10 days  Thursday... 

Other items of interest... 

Brown's continuous and vehement denials haven't  stopped the speculation 
regarding his future role with the team...  SportsLine.com jumped on the 
bandwagon this week when the  reported that the man I like to call the 
""Neanderthal GM"" is thinking seriously  about reducing his own role and 
bringing in a ""football man,"" along the lines of  former Steeler director of 
football operations and current ESPN  NFL maven Tom Donahoe, to handle the 
day-to-day front office  duties... 

Brown's response to another report stating that a  handful of ""close friend"" 
had advised him to step down and let somebody else  handle the team's 
football operations was classic: 

""I don't have five friends,"" he stated flatly...  

And finally... Rookie wide out Peter  Warrick said his skipping a 
team-mandated eye appointment last Tuesday  was an oversight. But if he skips 
another one it will cost him. 

Team officials set up the checkup because they  believe Warrick needs contact 
lenses. Receivers coach Steve  Mooshagian felt strongly enough about it to 
levy a $600 fine if Warrick  goes AWOL again...

GROH UPBEAT AS MARTIN  CONTINUES TO MAKE PROGRESS...

ESPN's John Clayton reported last night  that New York Jets halfback Curtis 
Martin took all  of his regular snaps Friday and should be fine for Sunday's 
game  against the Colts. 

Martin still has a bruised gluteus  maximus, but he's in better shape than 
last week. The fact that he  opened the week listed a probable rather than 
starting out as  questionable like last week has to be a good sign. 

And if you asked me, head coach  Al Groh seemed to be quite a bit more upbeat 
this  week, at one point responding to a reporters request that he assess  
Martin's current condition by saying, ""Fine, fine..."" 

That's about as in-depth, detailed and  upbeat reply I've heard him utter 
this season. 

But seriously folks... The soreness in  Martin's booty could linger, but it 
won't keep the former Patriot  out of the lineup... And with Bernie Parmalee  
emerging as a legitimate threat in a relief role, the Jets seem to  be 
capable of getting the job done. 

Also of interest this morning... 

Rookie tight end Anthony  Becht now has a neck injury to go along with the 
sore knee  that's bothered him the last two weeks. However, the youngtster 
is  expected to start and play as usual at this point... Fellow rookie  
Laveranues Coles will miss his second straight game  with a knee sprain and 
his absence has clearly left a void in the  team's vertical passing game the 
last two weeks... On a more postive  note, Coles was able to get some light 
work in during practice late  this week and could return at or near full 
speed sometime next  week... In the meantime, Windrell Hayes will  continue 
to come off the bench as the number-three man until Coles  return... 

Former Steeler wide out Malcolm  Johnson is becoming part of the Jets system 
as expected,  Groh said. The newcomer's biggest challenge is simply learning 
how  the Jets operate. 

""He's getting more comfortable with the  plays and the words,"" Groh said. 
""Every team has a different  language and you have to adjust to that. He 
seems to be a quick  student, he just needs to get through all the 
lessons..."" 

And finally... While the Jets obviouly  have some kind of plan in mind for 
implementing Leon  Johnson, it's too early to tell when he might be able to  
follow through on such a plan. 

""We saw some of the skills that made him  a good player in the past,"" Groh 
said of Johnson's first workout  with the team on Wednesday. ""But you also 
saw that he started  training camp (Wednesday)."" 

After blowing out his left knee in the  Jets' season opener last year, 
Johnson is eager to work his way back  into the mix... 

""Some guys take two days to get ready in  training camp,"" Groh said. ""Some 
guys take 10 days or two weeks.  That's where we are with Leon."" 

""I'm feeling good,"" Johnson said. ""It's  just real good to be back out there. 
That's really all I'm concerned  with right now."" 

The Jets would love for him to return to  form quickly so he can resume 
kick-return duties soon and relieve  Dedric Ward, who has not been 
impressive...

BIAKABUTUKA OUT; HOOVER  TO START VS. RAMS...

According to reports out of Carolina tonight, the  Panthers will hit the 
field this Sunday without Tim  Biakabutuka, who is struggling to overcome a 
painful turf  toe injury, for the third week in a row... According to  ESPN 
NFL insider John Clayton, the  Panthers deactivated the former first-round 
draft pick because they  didn't want to ruin his chances of playing the final 
three weeks of  the season. 

Brad Hoover, an  undrafted rookie from Western Carolina, will continue to 
line up as  the starting halfback. 

His 117-yard, one-TD performance in  Monday night's win over the Packers 
added exponentially to the  sudden celebrity status Hoover attained after his 
first game as the  starter. 

""This whole thing has just been crazy,""  he said. ""I've never gotten this 
much attention before and I'm still  trying to figure out how to handle it."" 

Count St. Louis signal caller  Kurt Warner among Hoover's fans... 

""I always like that stuff, it's always  good to see guys that were never 
given much of a chance to come in  and really make a name and do well for 
themselves,"" the former Arena  League star noted... 

Heck, Biakabutuka even admitted to mixed  emotions as he stood on the 
sidelines watching fans respond to  Hoover in a way they've never responded 
to him. However, the former  University of Michigan star also realizes just 
how hard Hoover has  worked -- in almost total obscurity -- prior to getting 
this break,  all of which made it hard not to be happy for his teammate. 

But Biakabutuka also found himself just a  little bit worried after teammate 
Michael Bates  told him the story of fella named Wally Pipp, who  played 
first base for the New York Yankees. Or at least he did until  the day this 
new kid named Lou Gehrig came along  and filled in for him... 

""I don't want to be Wally Pipp,""  Biakabutuka said earnestly. 

Other items of interest... 

Wide receiver Donald  Hayes, who missed Monday night's game with a groin 
injury,  is expected to return to the starting lineup this week. 

Veteran fullback William  Floyd will also spend another week on the inactive 
list;  Chris Hetherington will continue to start in his  place...

I definitely think trips on occasional plays will work.  Draw up some.  Try 
and make everything on one sheet so we can print it out and just take one 
piece of paper out there.  I will also draw up some and put it on whatever 
sheet you send me.

I was thinking that if we run trips on offense the other team won't know what 
hit them.  So I will draw up some plays.

Hi everyone,

I just wanted to say thanks again for donating to JDF.  The walk was Sunday, 
and the turnout was great!  Last I heard, Enron employees (including 
matching) contributed a total of $468,000!!  I really appreciate your 
generosity--hopefully it will help find a cure for diabetes!

Thanks!!

On Monday of this week the number of Financial deals transacted on EOL 
increased by approximately 1000 deals per day.    In addition,
the machine that the faxing process and Sitara runs on was down Tuesday for 
four hours do to a machine failure.

As a result of the increased EOL volumes and the machine downtime, the faxing 
backlog has grown significantly.  Invoices have
the highest priority so they should go out as quickly as before, the confirms 
will take some time.

We have been working on upgrading the hardware the faxing process runs on for 
some time and  have now focused all resources on this task
as a result of the increased EOL volumes.  We have called in additional 
support from the Facsys ( the software that faxes the documents ) reseller.  

It is likely that all confirmations queued to fax today will not reach their 
destination until sometime this weekend.  

Please cqll me at 3-7569 if you have any questions.

Thanks, Ron

"
"them. He still has the tools to be an integral part of a Fantasy title team.  

 Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/10/00 
 On 11 carries, Pittman ran for minus one yard. If Jake Plummer continues to 
battle injuries, opponents will tee off on Pittman. Thomas Jones also looked 
good in garbage time and very well could see more playing time in the final 
two games.  

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 On six catches, Dawkins finished with 85 yards and a pair of touchdowns. As 
expected, he took advantage of the awful Denver secondary but he is still not 
a reliable starter during the Fantasy playoffs.   

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/10/00 
 While running for 89 yards on 17 carries, Richardson added eight catches for 
56 yards. He should keep the starting halfback job in Kansas City for the 
season's final two games.   

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 Reaching the end zone on the ground and through the air, George ran 24 times 
for 81 yards and a touchdown, while catching four passes for 20 yards and two 
more scores. George will definitely be the MVP of many Fantasy championship 
teams this year.   

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 The Jaguars' wideout caught eight passes for 147 yards and a touchdown. He 
appears to be rasing his level of play just in time for the final rounds of 
the Fantasy playoffs.      

 Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/10/00 
 Kaufman left Sunday's game against the Jets in the second quarter after 
injuring his right knee. He was taken to the locker room for further 
examnination.  

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 On seven catches, Patten racked up 103 yards and a touchdown. Patten has 
showed signs of promise this year, but has lacked consistency when 
healthy.      

 Shannon Sharpe , TE BAL - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 The veteran tight end caught just one pass for seven yards. Trent Dilfer 
appears to be speading the ball among many WRs, and Sharpe has suddenly 
become a non-factor in the Baltimore offense.   

 Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - FIBSABs Updated 12/10/00 
 In a valiant effort, Bledsoe completed 26 of 45 passes for 225 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions. The veteran QB might continue to perform 
well in New England's final two games.   

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 79 yards and the Dolphins' lone touchdown. 
Despite facing the Tampa Bay run defense, Smith did not let his owners down 
at a crucial time of year.   

 Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/10/00 
 On 18 carries, Dillon picked up only 42 yards. The Cincinnati RB still has a 
tendency to disappear against the league's better defenses.  

 Ryan Wetnight , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Wetnight suffered a concussion in Sunday's win over Detroit.  

 Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Hatchette left Sunday's game in the second half after pulling a muscle on 
his side.  Troy Walters replaced Hatchette as the third wideout.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Aikman left Sunday's game in the first half with a concussion. He was 
replaced by Anthony Wright. Randall Cunningham is the team's emergency QB 
this week because of his recent groin problems.  

 Anthony Wright , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Wright replaced an injured Troy Aikman early in the second quarter of 
Sunday's game against Washington.  

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 12/10/00 
 Fiedler suffered an injured left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 
Buccaneers.  The injury seemed to affect his accuracy as he threw four 
interceptions in the game.  Keep an eye on his situation.  The injury may 
warrant you dropping him from your Fantasy lineup next week.       

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 McNair was lifted in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. 
Jeff Fisher replaced him with Neil O'Donnell, deciding McNair needed a 
well-deserved rest to keep him healthy after throwing three TD passes.  

 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 12/10/00 
 Taylor left Sunday's game against Jacksonville in the third quarter with the 
Jaguars leading 30-3. He seemed to suffer a minor injury to his knee that had 
been bothering him earlier in the year, but he remained on the sidelines and 
appeared to be in good condition.   

 Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Greisen replaced an ineffective Dave Brown in the third quarter of Sunday's 
game at Jacksonville.

Some Road to the Presidency
Al Gore is contesting the Presidential election not from clawing ambition,
his spinners tell us, but because he has divined that he really won. Maybe
so. A mind that can count a dimpled chad as a vote is capable of believing
about anything.

Mr. Gore's professed high-mindedness would be easier to credit, though, if
it were not washed in the casual attitude toward the truth that we have come
to expect from the author of no controlling legal authority, the Buddhist
Temple fund-raiser and the iced tea defense.

The Vice President in his Monday speech to the nation repeated the
professions of supermouthpiece David Boies, for example, that there were
10,000 votes in Miami-Dade uncounted. These are in fact votes that were
machine-counted for other offices but did not register a vote for President.
The common-sense view of such a ballot is that the voter wanted to be heard
on other offices, but did not like either candidate for President. There
were 175,000 such ballots across the state of Florida, and 1.25 million
across the nation.

What Mr. Gore really wants is to pour over the 10,000 Miami-Dade ballots in
search of the mysterious ""dimpled chad"" votes for him. Bear in mind that the
county's board back on Nov. 14 shut down its first recount after a sampling
of three precincts turned up only six more votes for Mr. Gore. That seemed
in retrospect to be the sort of reasonable action so thought to be missing
from this endless exercise. The Democrat sued, forcing Miami-Dade to resume.

The Gore team currently argues that Miami-Dade is an undiscovered motherlode
of Gore votes because in the 135 of 614 precincts counted they produced a
Gore gain of 157 votes. But the recount went through the precincts
numerically, and the first tranche, heavily Democratic, are known to have
voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Gore. While those 135 initially counted
precincts gave Mr. Gore 73% of their vote, the Vice President's share of the
whole county was 53%. Those potent projections of Gore numbers from a full
recount that they're citing are undoubtedly an exaggeration.

The Gore lawsuit against Palm Beach is richer still. Here they are literally
arguing that poor Judge Burton and his colleagues didn't use sufficiently
low dimple standards, what the lawsuit calls ""incorrect legal standards,"" to
accept Gore votes. Here as well we have a Democratic county and board, upon
whom the Gore folks were heaping praise less than two weeks ago, which
they're now suing.

In Seminole County, ""independent"" Democrats have sued to kill absentee
ballots certified for Governor Bush, who carried those votes by almost 2 to
1. Their case: The county's elections supervisor broke the law by letting
GOP office workers enter voter identification numbers left off of request
forms sent in by absentee voters, who had otherwise complied by signing the
form and listing the last four digits of their Social Security number. Want
more detail? Normally the ID numbers are preprinted on the forms before
they're sent out, which is what the Democrats did, but the GOP's software. .
. . Oh well, the Democrats are suing.

So let's review the story so far. We had a Florida count Nov. 7, then a
recount, and then we let Al Gore pick several famously Democratic counties
to hand-count; we've let various amounts of ambiguous chads be counted, let
his party officials eyeball the ballots, often going his way by a 2 to 1
vote, let a GOP counter in Broward resign, extended the pre-established
deadline and, let's see, what else? Oh yes, Mr. Gore still lost.

The Gore/Boies strategy now is essentially to sue everyone in sight, hoping
that some cache of votes reopens (Dade) or closes up (Seminole). His lawyers
argued yesterday that he'd already be ahead if so many military ballots
weren't counted. This is not ""counting every vote""; it's asking lawyers to
overturn an election, not once but several times. And it's becoming
increasingly apparent to the American people; two national polls put support
for a Gore concession at 60%, a strikingly high number given the close
election result.

As to the Democrats, a few have wavered publicly on joining the Gore long
march, but mostly the party is circling the two exhausted candidates, on the
one hand standing behind Mr. Gore's attempt to reverse the election, while
simultaneously demanding to share power with the incoming Bush
Administration.

All this said, we have in fact found one Gore gambit to really admire:
Identifying that five-minute seam of network time for a speech at 8:55 p.m.,
five minutes before the start of Monday night football. Pretty clever. The
dimpled-ballot standard may not stand up, but opening up that 8:55
prime-time window for political speech may last forever.

1   Talking Points to Set the Record Straight
2   Statement by Secretary James A. Baker, III
3   What They're Saying...
_________________________________________________________________


1
TALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT

MYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have
never been counted.

BOIES:  ""[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been
counted once for the presidency of the United States.""  [Today
Show, 11/27/00]

FACT:
~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once
  on election night and again during the automatic recount.

~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots
  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in
  every race on the ballot, including races for President.

~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,
  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in
  Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.

~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)
  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute
  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.  These ballots
  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for
  President.

~ This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote
  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be
  undecided about the choice for President.  In particular, a
  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may
  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable
  with his or her party's choice for President and yet
  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  So he or
  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for
  President.


MYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been
counted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead
by 9 votes.

FACT:
~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and
  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach
  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by
  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of
  the certified votes from Nassau County.

~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday
  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory
  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.

~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme
  Court's deadline.

~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not
  proceeding with a manual recount.

~ The 157 ""interim gain"" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a
  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.  Gore won
  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while
  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  It would be
  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican
  precincts, too.  Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those
  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,
  favored Bush.  The Gore approach would treat these minorities
  in a discriminatory fashion.

~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and
  federal law should be counted.  Counties recognized this and
  counted them.  Even Joe Lieberman said that such military
  ballots should not be rejected.


MYTH:  Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not
for the Republican ""mob"" that ""intimidated"" the canvassing board.

   KLAIN:  ""We think already almost 160 votes were counted in
   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...  But I think
   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a
   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a
   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept
   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the
   kind of end that we have to American elections.""
   [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]

FACT:
~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's
  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it
  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit
  the recount to only a select set of the votes.

~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the
  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated
  clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd.

~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,
  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  The crowd was
  quieted promptly.


MYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by
adding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by
the board as illegal.

FACT:
~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the
  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from
  the rest, and not counted.  As a result, Bush received 124
  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election
  night.

~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor
  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.  Because the
  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final
  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of
  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the
  count to make it accurate.

~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to
  certify the original election night count - which included the
  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which
  mistakenly omitted those ballots).

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Regrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit
contesting the certified election results in Florida.  Their
aim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of
counts and recounts.

As I said last night, America has never had a presidential
election decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.
This is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,
uncertain, and controversial territory.

Therefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of
the litigation team who will be defending the vote of
Floridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.

I have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,
Florida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.  Mr.
Richard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of
Florida, has 33 years of trial experience.

Other members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of
the law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.  Together they
bring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.

The other two members of our senior litigation team are law
partners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.  Together,
Daryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience
practicing in court.

These five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the
overall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on
four issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize.

WHAT THEY'RE SAYING...

Quotes from Democrats:

""It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last
legal limit to get the election...I don't think he should.""
  - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin;
    Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00


U.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, will vote for
Texas Gov. George W. Bush if the presidential race is ultimately
decided by the U.S. House of Representatives.

""I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth
Congressional District voted.  And in this case, Governor Bush
carried [my district].""
  - The (Mississippi) Sun Herald, 11/28/00


Monday, Indiana House Speaker John Gregg, D-Sandborn, called on
Gore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election
in doubt for 20 days.


"
"""He needs to pick up the phone, call Austin and say, 'Mr.
President, congratulations. I support you as president 100
percent.""
  - Indianapolis Star, 11/26/00


Self-described liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBC's ""Hardball
with Chris Matthews,"" 11/27/00:
""They're talking about 26,000 people that they said their votes
didn't count.  There are 35,000 other people in Florida who's
votes were not counted that lie in George Bush country...Many,
many more are Bush votes and they don't say a word about that.""


Quotes from Media:

Peggy Noonan on Fox News Channel's ""Hannity and Colmes,"" 11/27/00:
""...a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without
having that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of
thought and logic and argument...

""You cannot say of the ballot, just because nobody voted for Bush
or Gore, that it's really a secret Gore vote that didn't get
counted...""


Salon.com's Joan Walsh, 11/28/00:
""His condescending, singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday
night was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was
almost insulting.""


Don Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBC's ""Imus in the Morning,""
11/28/00:
Imus:  ""What if Gore had won, and Bush...I mean, what if the
roles were reversed, how would, I wouldn't want to include you in
this, but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be
treating all this if the roles were reversed.""

Fineman: ""Oh my God, ...you kidding?!  That George Bush
was a cry baby, that he was the spoiled son of a failed
President.  You know, you can just here it.  The personal attacks
on Bush would be just absolutely vicious.""


Ceci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC, 11/27/00:
Connolly:  ""But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore, that
you sometimes get, that has turned off many Americans over time.
And you also got a little bit of whining, frankly, when he
started talking about voter intimidation.""

Reid:  ""Some thought it very odd, why they had all the
photographers in there flashing.  It was a bit distracting.  And
the flags, some people think maybe it's an overdose on the flags.
And another question:  a very formal setting for a very personal
conversation with the American people.""


Howard Fineman on MSNBC, 11/27/00:
Fineman: ""He (Gore) had to make clear to people that there was
something about him, some essential goodness in him, that made
it worth fighting this fight.  And when he said, 'If I lose, so
be it,' he had to be convincing on that point.  And I must say,
after all the arguing in this very divided election, it's going
to be hard for most Americans to agree with that...

""...most Americans think that this election was fair.  He's got
to make the case that it isn't, and it's hard for him to do it.

""...political terms, I'm not sure how much time he really has...""

This is Funny!

A man was doing a study of children's senses in a
first-grade class using Lifesaver candies .  He would ask them to
identify the color and then the flavor as they tasted the Lifesaver.
The children began to say,

""Red...cherry""
""Yellow...lemon""
""Green...lime""
""Orange...orange""

Finally, he gave them all honey flavored Lifesavers. The
children sucked on them for a while, but they couldn't decipher the
taste. ""Well"" he said, ""I'll give you a clue.  It's what your
mother would call your father!"" One little girl looked up in horror.  She
quickly spit the  Lifesaver out and shouted, ""Everybody, spit it out.
They're assholes!""

Hey Y'all,

Less then 2 weekes before I'm back in Paradise (Texas, not Hawaii),  lookin
forward to seein all ya that I can.  Here's a little note to spread the
holiday cheer.



Subject:  Johnny Christmas Letter

Dear Santa,
You must be surprised I am writing you today, the 26th of
December. Well I would very much like to clear up certain things that have
occurred since the beginning of the month! While filled with illusions, I
wrote you a letter.  I asked for a bicycle, an electric train set, a pair of
roller blades, and a football uniform.  I destroyed my brain studying the
whole year!  Not only was I
first in my class, but I had the best grades in the whole school. I'm not
going to lie to you Santa; there was no one in the entire neighborhood that
behaved better than me. With my parents, my brothers, friends and my
neighbors, I would go on errands and even help the elderly across the
street.  There was virtually nothing I wouldn't do for humanity! WHAT BALLS
YOU HAVE LEAVING ME A FUCKING YO-YO, A STUPID ASS WHISTLE,AND A PAIR OF
SOCKS!!!What the FUCK were you THINKING, YOU FAT SON OF A BITCH!?!?!That
you've taken me for a SUCKER THE WHOLE FUCKING YEAR, to come out with some
SHIT LIKE THIS under the damn tree.  AS IF YOU HADN'T FUCKED ME ENOUGH,YOU
GAVE THAT LITTLE SHITHEAD ACROSS THE STREET SO MANY FUCKING TOYS, HECAN'T
EVEN WALK INTO HIS DAMN HOUSE! Please don't let me see you trying to fit
your BIG ASS DOWN MY CHIMNEY NEXT YEAR! I'LL FUCK YOU UP! I'll throw rocks
at those STUPID ASS REINDEERS OF YOURS, AND SCARE THEM THE FUCK AWAY, SO
YOU'LL HAVE TO WALK YOUR BIG FAT ASS EVERYWHERE, JUST LIKE I HAVE TO DO
SINCE YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT FUCKING BIKE, YOU PUNK BITCH. You know what
Santa, FUCK YOU!!  Next year you'll find out HOW BAD I CAN REALLY FUCKING
BE...YOU'VE BEEN STEPPING ON THIS MOTHERFUCKER FAR TOO LONG!
SO WATCH YOUR BACK NEXT YEAR, YOU FAT BITCH!

Sincerely,
Johnny

Three heavily Democratic counties continue to handcount
ballots that were meant to be counted by machine.

As the process continues, it has become apparent why
machines are used to count these ballots.

There have been reports of Bush ballots in the Gore
pile, counters using ballots as fans, and chads on the
floor and on the counting tables....

Cick here to watch a member of the Miami-Dade County
Canvassing Board bend, scratch, poke and press a
ballot during the manual recount...

Speaking of SEC dominance, Brian and I made a 100 dollar bet this weekend.  
Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour"" which 
will be paid for by Brian ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12"" 
Hoskins.

Place and time TBD

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 German was added to the injury report with a strained hamstring and is 
listed as probable for Sunday's game.  He was used as the third receiver 
earlier this season when Tim Dwight was sidelined with various injuries but 
has done little to push for extra playing time.  German has just one catch 
all season.     

 Packers , DT GB - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 The Packers have a tough test ahead of them this week when they face the 
Colts and the trio of Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James, and Marvin Harrison.  
Their pass defense has been mediocre this season totaling 25 sacks and 
allowing 216.3 yards per game.  They will need to apply a little more 
pressure on Indianapolis to contain Manning and Harrison.  Look for Green Bay 
to come at Manning with multiple blitz coverages but that may not be enough 
for them to have success against the Colts and their balanced attack.    

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - Fear Updated 11/17/00 
 Jones has come down with a case of walking pneumonia, and likely won't 
travel with the team on their trip to Philadelphia for this week's game 
against the Eagles. Jones has been a real disappointment to Fantasy owners 
thus far, accounting for only 410 yards of total offense and two touchdowns 
this season.  

 David Sloan , TE DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/17/00 
 Sloan practiced Thursday and is expected to play in Sunday's game.  He is 
recovering from a pulled hamstring that kept him out of last week's game.  
Sloan has caught seven passes in his last two games but has failed to score  
a touchdown this season.    

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 11/17/00 
 With the injury to Sammy Morris, it looks as though Bryson will get the 
start this week against the Chiefs.  If Morris has been one of your main 
tailbacks this season, it may be a good idea to pick up Bryson if he is still 
available.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/17/00 
 Morris remains questionable for Sunday's game against the Chiefs with an 
ankle injury.  Head Coach Wade Phillips believes that Morris will be a 
game-time decision, so keep the Bills' rookie tailback on the bench this week 
if at all possible.   


"
" Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 11/17/00 
 Favre practiced Thursday and is expected to start Sunday's game at 
Indianapolis.  ""The ball came out sharp,"" said offensive coordinator Tom 
Rossley.  ""He was right on the money. I was pleased with what he did today.""  
If Favre can stay in the game this Sunday he could have a big day.  The Colts 
have one of the weaker pass defenses in the NFL, having allowed 15 TD passes 
this season.    

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Mean Machine Updated 11/16/00 
 Sanders had his best game in five weeks last Sunday, catching five passes 
for 82 yards in Arizona's 31-14 loss to the Vikings. He is currently battling 
a quadricep injury, but is listed as probable for this week's matchup with 
the Eagles.  It would be a wise move to bench Sanders this week, especially 
against an aggressive Philadelphia secondary.   

 Jake Plummer , QB ARI - FDIC Updated 11/16/00 
 Plummer completed 19-of-28 passes for 219 yards last Sunday against the 
Vikings, but was held without a touchdown pass.  In fact, ""The Snake"" has 
thrown only one touchdown pass in the last four weeks. Things won't get 
better for Plummer this week against the Eagles, who will blitz him 
relentlessly and likely force him to make bad decisions.    

 Troy Brown , WR NE - FDIC Updated 11/16/00 
 Brown caught only two passes for ten yards last Sunday against the Browns.  
Although he has shown flashes of brilliance in the past, Brown is far too 
inconsistent to be considered a starter by most Fantasy league standards.  

 Adam Vinatieri , K NE - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Vinatieri has connected on eight consecutive field goal attempts, dating 
back to Week Four against the Dolphins. With New England's offense sputtering 
in recent weeks, don't expect much from Vinatieri this week against the 
Bengals.    

 Rod Rutledge , TE NE - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Rutledge caught three passes for 20 yards last Sunday against the Browns, 
including his first career touchdown. With the release of Erich Bjornson, he 
should become more involved in the Patriots' offense in the coming weeks.  If 
you relied on Bjornson as your everday tight end, it would be a wise move to 
pickup Rutledge.     

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/00 
 Pickens was held out of practice yesterday because of his injured hamstring. 
He has missed four of his last six games, but Coach Jeff Fisher says that he 
is improving. Pickens will likely be a gametime decision.  

 Bashir Yamini , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 The Titans may need to make a roster move with their injuries at wide 
receiver. One possibility is to sign Yamini, who is on the practice squad and 
was on the roster earlier in the year, to replace Chris Jackson, who will be 
out for the remainder of the year with a herniated disc in his back. Jackson 
had recently been signed off the practice squad.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 George was able to participate fully in practice yesterday after receiving a 
cortisone shot for his injured right big toe earlier in the week. He plans on 
getting more involved in practice this week and hopes to get it strong enough 
to play Sunday against Cleveland. The only real concern here is whether 
George may develop turf toe, which could require surgery. Keep a close eye on 
him, and be sure to insure your roster with his backup, Rodney Thomas.  

 Wade Richey , K SF - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Richey has struggled recently missing four of his last six field-goal 
tries.  Last year Richey made 21-of-23 attempts.  He should get a lot of 
attempts this week against the Falcons.  San Francisco should be able to move 
the chains against Atlanta, but with Terrell Owens suffering from turf toe, 
The Niners will have problems scoring touchdowns.    

 Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Beasley missed last Sunday's game because of left-knee and ankle injuries 
and remains questionable for this week.  Terry Jackson will start at fullback 
if Beasley is unable to play.  In the beginning of the season the Niners 
threw to Beasley in goal-line situations.  Recently they have chosen to let 
Charlie Garner run the ball or to throw to their wideouts.   Beasley scored 
five touchdowns in the first three games, but has none since then.    

 Jerry Rice , WR SF - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/16/00 
 Rice sat out of practice Wednesday to rest his sore back.  He is expected to 
play this week and is listed as probable on the injury report.  Rice had five 
catches for 59 yards in the season opener against Atlanta.  At this point in 
his career Rice has very little Fantasy value.  He is being used mainly for 
routes over the middle and as a decoy in goal line situations.    

 Chad Dukes , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 To add depth to its backfield, St. Louis has signed Dukes, who spent time on 
the Redskins' roster earlier this season.  Dukes will probably be the backup 
halfback against the Redskins Monday behind Justin Watson.  Regular backup 
Trung Canidate is out for the season after breaking his right wrist Sunday.   
 

 Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Ramiro Updated 11/16/00 
 Hakim is suffering from a fractured rib but head coach Mike Martz said he 
will play against the Redksins Monday.  This week's matchup could be the 
ultimate test for the Rams' receiving team this week as they go up against 
one of the best secondaries in the league.  Start all of your Rams receivers 
as usual but don't be surprised if some of them struggle.    

 Andrew Glover , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Glover sat out practice Tuesday with a sore back and is listed as probable 
for Sunday's game against the Raiders.  He may catch a lot of passes against 
his former team this week.  The Saints are thin on offense, with Ricky 
Williams and Jake Reed sidelined by injury, so Glover could get a lot of 
balls thrown his way.  The Raiders have been succeptible to tight end routes 
this season.  Denver TEs combined for 125 yards and a TD against them last 
week.  Kansas City TE Tony Gonzalez had nine catches for 134 yards against 
Oakland in Week 10.    

 Chris Hetherington , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Hetherington will make the second start of his five-year career Sunday 
against the Vikings.  Hetherington will be filling in for the injured William 
Floyd who suffered broken ribs last week.  He is not as gifted offensively as 
Floyd though, and will be used primarily for blocking assignments.     

 Kris Mangum , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Mangum exited last Sunday's game after the first quarter and did not return 
due to a sprained shoulder.  Mangum's shoulder has allowed him to be more 
flexible in practice and he appeared to be ready for this week's game at 
Minnesota.  ""We'll see,"" Mangum told the Rock Hill Herald .  ""I tried last 
week. I guess I came back a little early. We'll try again this week and see 
what happens.""  Mangum was supposed to start at tight end in place of the 
injured Wesley Walls but his shoulder ailment has sidelined him as well.  
Rookie Casey Crawford will start at TE once again if Mangum is unable to play 
Sunday.        

 Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Hoover has been working out with the first team this week in preparation for 
a possible start against the Vikings Sunday.  Starter Tim Biakabutuka is 
suffering from turf toe and is questionable for the game at Minnesota.  At 
this point in the season selecting Hoover would be a gamble, even if he does 
start Sunday.  Carolina hasn't run the ball too well this season, averaging 
79.4 yards per game.  It might be safer to use a starting back from another 
team even if the player hasn't been too productive.    

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/16/00 
 Kitna was named the AFC's Offensive Player of the Week yesterday after 
passing for three touchdowns in Seattle's 28-21 victory over Jacksonville.  
His reward?  A return to the bench, in all likelihood.  He is expected to be 
the backup to Brock Huard after the bye in a November 26th game against the 
Denver Broncos.    

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 Owens is still bothered by the turf toe injury that limited his playing time 
in the team's 21-7 win over Kansas City.  Head coach Steve Mariucci is 
seriously considering holding Owens out of this week's game.  Owens still 
leads the NFL in TD receptions with 11 and is third in catches, but the turf 
toe injury could slow him down for the rest of the season.  If he can't play 
Sunday wideout J.J. Stokes would make his second straight start in place of 
him.  

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Leaf may now get the starting nod for this week's game against Denver.  Head 
Coach Mike Riley stated earlier in the week that Jim Harbaugh would be the 
starter, but now says that he will wait a day or two before making a 
decision.  Look elsewhere for a quarterback this week if your roster allows 
it.    

 Jim Harbaugh , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Harbaugh was named the starter for Sunday's game against the Broncos earlier 
in the week, but Head Coach Mike Riley may now be retracting that statement.  
Ryan Leaf took an equal number of snaps as Harbaugh in practice on Wednesday, 
and may get the nod on Sunday.  Riley said that he plans to wait another day 
or two before announcing a starter.  If at all possible, go with another 
quarterback this week.     

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/16/00 
 Jacksonville will be without linebackers Hardy Nickerson and Lonnie Marts, 
and probably without cornerback Aaron Beasley, for Sunday's game in 
Pittsburgh. Nickerson, who missed three games with a hamstring injury and the 
last two recovering from knee surgery, went to California yesterday for a 
second opinion and could be out a few more weeks. Marts is still recovering 
from a groin injury, and Beasley is listed as questionable with a back injury 
but is unlikely to play. Rookie T.J. Slaughter, Erik Storz and Jason Craft 
would get the starts at their respective positions. Pittsburgh has a subpar 
passing game, but its running game, led by Jerome Bettis, could give the 
Jaguars' defense fits come Sunday.    

 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - The Lie Downs Updated 11/16/00 
 Wheatley is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Saints.  He 
didn't play in Monday night's loss to the Broncos, and will be re-evaluated 
by Head Coach Jon Gruden during practice the rest of the week.  Oakland is 
reportedly talking about signing running back Terry Kirby for this week's 
game, which could be a bad sign if you have Wheatley on your Fantasy 
roster.

AL GORE WENT DOWN TO FLORIDA

Al Gore went down to Florida He was lookin' for an election to steal.
He was in a bind Cause he was way behind, And he was willin' to cut a
deal. When he came across a Gov'ner Knawin' on a victory and chewin' hard,
Veep Gore jumped up on a hickory stump and said, ""Gov, let me tell you what""

""I bet you didn't know it but I'm a contender in Florida too, and if you
care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.
Now you ran a good campaign down here, but give Al Gore his due.
I'll bet a nation of gold and the white house it holds, that I got more
votes than you!""

The gov'ner said, ""My names Dubya and it might be a sin....  But I'll
take that bet, you're gonna regret, cause this Texan always wins""

(Chorus)

Dubya rally up your troops and fight for that vote hard.  Cause Al
Gore's loose in Florida and Bill Daley holds the cards.  If you win you get
that shiny nation, made of gold, but if you lose, then Al Gore gets con-trol.

Al Gore opened up his mouth and said ""I'll start this show""
And fire burned in the eyes of lawyers, who knew they'd make some dough.
And he pulled his hand across his lips, and he made an evil grin.
Then in walked all the Palm Beach voters, Dubya's chances were lookin'
thin.

(Guitar/bass solo)

When Al Gore finished, Dubya said...  ""Well, your pretty good ol' son.
Now plant your butt in that chair right there and let me show you how it's
done!""

(Chorus II)

Dems in the orange groves, Run George, Run.  You can't lose now in the 
land of the sun.  Your dads on your side and your brothers' in tow, Gore in 
the White
House, God, Please NO!

(Fast Fiddle/Guitar solo)

AL Gore bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.
He conceded that golden nation on the Ground at Dubya's feet.
Dubya said, ""Gore, just come on back if ya ever wanna try again, cause I
told you once you tree huggin' dunce, this Texan always wins!""

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  ""We'll see Wednesday or Thursday,"" said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, ""but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play.""    

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.     

 Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 The status of the Jets' running back for this week's game against the Bears 
is still uncertain.  Martin left Sunday's game in Miami with what was 
described as a strained back, and never returned to the field.  He had an 
examination by team doctors yesterday, and had some X-rays taken as well.  
The club hasn't released any information on the resluts of the exam.  If 
Martin is on your Fantasy squad, your best bet is to stay tuned as the week 
progresses.     

 Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 According to New York Newsday , Coles will be unable to play in this week's 
game against the Bears.  He was hit on the knee during the opening kickoff of 
the second half in Sunday's win over the Dolphins.  If Coles is an integral 
part of your roster, look to pick up Dedric Ward, who should get more playing 
time in Coles' absence.    

 Billy Joe Tolliver , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints re-signed Tolliver yesterday, after the 10-year veteran had been 
cut by the team during training camp. With Jeff Blake out for the season, New 
Orleans needed a No. 3 quarterback, so Tolliver will fill that role behind 
starter Aaron Brooks and backup Jake Delhomme.  

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints placed Blake on injured reserve yesterday, officially ending his 
season. He will have surgery on his fractured and dislocated right foot as 
soon as the swelling subsides and the extent of the damage is determined. 
Blake will be replaced by Aaron Brooks.  

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith's status is still not certain, but he does expect to return for 
Sunday's game against the Colts.  He left last week's game against the Jets 
after aggravating his strained right hamstring, an injury which he sustained 
a week earlier against the Chargers.  Smith has been one of the year's 
biggest Fantasy sleepers, and has become an everyday starter for those 
Fantasy owners who were lucky enough to grab him.  If he does in fact play 
this week, be sure to include him in your starting lineup.    

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Although his status is still up in the air, Fiedler expects that he will be 
ready to play in Sunday's AFC showdown against the Colts.  Fiedler was 
injured on the first play of the Jets' game when linebacker Mo Lewis drove 
his head and shoulder into the turf. He suffered a slightly seperated 
throwing shoulder and developed muscle spasms in his back.  Fielder isn't one 
of the better options in the Fantasy game, so avoid playing him this week 
even if he does start.  

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/21/00 
 The Redskins should know by Thursday if Johnson can re-assume his starting 
job for this week's showdown against the Eagles.  He has started to test his 
injured left knee with some light dropbacks and will likely push the knee 
harder during practice on Wednesday and Thursday.    

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With the injury to Ike Hilliard, Jurevicius will likely start this week's 
game at Arizona.  With only 12 receptions on the entire season, Jurevicius 
isn't a solid Fantasy option, so don't pick him up unless your roster is 
really straped for receivers.    

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Antoine Winfield has been lost for the rest of the season with a 
torn labrum in his right shoulder.  He suffered the injury three weeks ago 
against New England. Winfield has tried to play through the pain, but has 
aggravated the injury in each of Buffalo's last two games.  Head Coach Wade 
Phillips announced to the media that Winfield will have surgery on 
Wednesday.  His loss will hurt Buffalo's secondary, but they remain a solid 
defense in the world of Fantasy.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Huard the starter for this week's game 
against the Broncos.  Huard took all of the snaps with the first team offense 
after a bye week, and is ready to make his first start since sustaining a 
concussion on Oct. 22 in Oakland.  Huard isn't considered a solid Fantasy 
option, so don't start him until he shows some signs that he is ready to 
produce.    

 Cardinals , DT ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Arizona defense came out of Sunday's loss to the Eagles extremely banged 
up.  Linebacker Zach Walz, who just recently returned from knee surgery, is 
out with a broken left leg.  Defensive tackle Mark Smith hurt his shoulder 
and had his arm in a sling on Monday.  Safety Kwamie Lassiter was also 
injured in the game, suffering a sprained knee. With all of these injuries on 
defense, it's probably a good idea to keep the Cardinals' defense on the 
bench this week.      

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/20/00 
 Alstott probably will miss the rest of the regular season after spraining 
his left knee in Tampa Bay's 13-10 loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday.  The 
Bucs described Alstott's injury as a third-degree sprain of the medial 
collateral ligament and said he is expected to be sidelined six to eight 
weeks.  Charles Kirby, a third-year pro in his first season with Tampa Bay, 
will replace Alstott.     

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Meximullets Updated 11/20/00 
 Toomer posted a great day for his Fantasy owners against Detroit, catching 
eight passes for 108 yards in the Giants' 31-21 loss. He may have a more 
difficult time next week against Arizona's All-Pro cornerback Aeneas 
Williams, so start him at your own discretion.      

 Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Barber caught eight passes and compiled 129 yards of total offense in 
Sunday's loss to the Lions.  Look for Barber to get a number of looks out of 
the backfield this week against Arizona, as the Giants attempt to compensate 
for the loss of wide receiver Ike Hilliard.   

 Kerry Collins , QB NYG - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Collins threw a season-high 51 passes on Sunday, but it wasn't enough to 
tame the Lions.  Collins has been a more productive Fantasy option of late, 
throwing eight touchdown passes in his last three games. He may run into a 
road block this week against the Cardinals, however, especially if Ike 
Hilliard is unable to play.  Without Hilliard, Arizona can put All-Pro 
cornerback Aeneas Williams on Amani Toomer, leaving Tiki Barber and Pete 
Mitchell as Collins' only real receiving options. If you can find a better 
quarterback than Collins this week, it might be a good idea to use 
him.           

 James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 11/20/00 
 McKnight caught four passes for 50 yards in Sunday's loss at Baltimore.  He 
could, however, be a good sleeper pick this week against the Vikings.  
Minnesota's secondary can be beaten downfield, so look for McKnight to try 
and break a few long ones in an effort to spark a banged up Dallas offense.   
 

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Ramiro Updated 11/20/00 
 Smith had his second consecutive subpar performance on Sunday against the 
Ravens, rushing for only 48 yards on eleven carries. He has been held to only 
64 yards rushing in the past two weeks, which is significant when you 
consider that Smith is one of the league's greatest running backs of 
all-time.  The combination of a short week and the loss of center Mark 
Stepnoski will hurt Smith's production, so it might be a good idea to sit him 
this week if your roster allows it.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Aikman found out just how good the Ravens' defense is on Sunday.  He 
completed just 19-of-33 passes for 138 yards and three interceptions in 
Dallas' 27-0 loss in Baltimore. Aikman faces a Minnesota defense on 
Thanksgiving that has been solid in recent weeks, so don't expect any kind of 
Fantasy explosion from the Cowboys' aging quarterback.      

 Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/20/00 
 Hilliard, who left Sunday's game against the Lions with a bruised sternum 
and lung, will remain in the hospital for the next two days and will likely 
miss this Sunday's game against Arizona. Look for Joe Jurevicius to start in 
Hilliard's place, but don't expect him to produce the same type of numbers 
that Hilliard has posted.     

 Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/00 
 Anderson ran 17 times for 76 yards against the 49ers Sunday.  Although he 
has become more confident in putting weight on his bad knee, you probably 
won't see Anderson have a big game until next season.  Don't expect things to 
get any better for Anderson next week when he goes up against a tough Raiders 
run defense.     

 Johnnie Morton , WR DET - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/00 
 Morton awakened from his slumber to catch six passes for  78 yards against 
the Giants Sunday.  He only had one catch in each of the Lions last three 
games.  Morton will probably struggle once again this Thursday when the Lions 
face a formidable Patriots secondary.     

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 11/20/00 
 While completing 23-of-36 passes, Favre threw for 301  yards with two 
touchdowns and one interception.  He showed extreme toughness Sunday, 
starting the game despite suffering a sprained foot a week earlier.  He 
should be just as effective next week against a docile Panthers pass rush.

Sorry for the wide distribution.  However, I thought all my hunting buddies 
should be aware of what's going on.  Who knows we may be asked to register 
sling shots in the future.

Darron:

I am trying to track an origination for Fred Lagrasta.  Sherry Dawson said 
you would probably be the one to grant this origination.  The deal is HS 
Energy and the Deal number is V58190.  Fred would like to have this granted 
in April, so if I need to give you any additional information please let me 
know.


Thanks

This book is for the West desk.  Please call if you have any questions.


Stephanie,

We are breaking up our Central Midcon region into two books beginning July 
1.  To facilitate this, Sitara has set up two new internal books:  ENA-IM Mid 
Central South & ENA-IM Mid Central North.  It would be helpful if we could 
have any physical June EOL deals continue to be booked to ENA-IM Central but 
all physical July-out deals booked to the new books.  The two traders 
involved are Kelli Stevens and Ed Smith.

 Kelli Stevens ENA-IM Mid Central South
 Ed Smith ENA-IM Mid Central North

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do to expedite this 
request.  Thanks for your help.

Subject: WeaponX

I would like each of your book admins using WeaponX to begin using the 
following procedures at least once/week (if they aren't already).

Open the database while holding down on the shift key.  This will open the 
database, but prevent the main form from opening automatically.  Next, the 
admin should go to Access menu selections and choose Tools/Database 
Utilities/Compact Database.  After the database has completed compacting, you 
can use the database as normal.

Just a quick explanation:

This is standard procedure for Access databases.  WeaponX imports and deletes 
a lot of data on a daily basis.  When data is deleted, the space is not freed 
up that was used by the data.  Therefore, as time goes by, the database size 
grows and grows and needs to be periodically compacted.

The Texas WeaponX file that I compacted reduced from 520 MB to 30 MB and one 
for the west went from 400 MB to 12 MB.  You can see that we will save 
several GB if everyone begins compacting the databases on a regular basis.

Please note:  Even though this is standard Access procedure, I would 
recommend that the book admin save a copy of their existing WeaponX file 
prior to compacting for the first time.  Once the file is compacted and a 
daily run has been successful, they can delete the backup file.  It is not 
necessary for them to save a backup copy each time before compacting.  I am 
only recommending it for the first compact.

I don't anticipate any problems with this procedure.  As a matter of fact, 
Crystal (East desk I believe) already compacts the database on a daily 
basis.  In addition Ann (West desk) ran a test for me with no problems.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Phillip,

This is an internal candidate that has posted for your Spec. Risk Management 
position, Req. # 108798.  Please review and reply back to this e-mail if you 
are interested in meeting with this candidate. 

Chris Atherton- He is currently working for EES as a Regional Account Manager 
for the Energy Information Solutions division. He has no previous risk 

"
"Carolina won't put too much pressure on Favre, allowing him to dissect the 
secondary, and pile up Fantasy points.     

 Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Meximullets Updated 11/20/00 
 The Packers' wideout had what might have been his best game of the season 
against the Colts Sunday, racking up 155 yards on eight catches.  He won't 
continue to post numbers like this, but look for Schroeder to have some 
success against the Panthers this Sunday.     

 Ahman Green , RB GB - Ramiro Updated 11/20/00 
 Green ran for a career-high 153 yards on 24 carries Sunday against the 
Colts.  His success should continue in upcomings games against the weak run 
defenses of the Panthers, Bears, and Lions.   

 Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 In relief of Blake, the little-used Brooks completed 14-of-22 passes for 187 
yards, with two touchdowns and one  interception.  Owners of Jeff Blake may 
want to consider picking up Brooks.  It will take some time for Brooks to get 
used to playing in the NFL, but he could put up solid numbers in the final 
games of the season as the Saints face a plethora of weak pass defenses.

	Final home game for 13 Longhorns 
	 
	Nov. 16, 2000 
	 
	
	[IMAGE]Chip Brown, who covers Texas football for The Dallas Morning News, 
answers your questions about the Hex Rally, next year's schedule, Chris 
Simms, bowl prospects, recruiting, Texas A?and more. Inside UT Football 
appears on Thursdays. 
	
	 
	E-mail questions to Chip: chipbrown@dallasnews.com 
	
	
	 
	Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on
	DallasNews.com's Colleges site 
	
	
	
	Chip Shot 
	 
	
	Thirteen senior Longhorns will be playing their final home game when Texas 
meets Texas A?on Friday, Nov. 24. They will be honored in a pre-game 
ceremony. Among the seniors playing their final home game are six current 
starters: 
	
	 Free safety Greg Brown of Baton Rouge, La.; offensive tackle Leonard Davis 
of Wortham; defensive tackle Casey Hampton of Galveston Ball; running back 
Hodges Mitchell of Skyline; defensive tackle Shaun Rogers of LaPorte; and 
placekicker Kris Stockton of Katy. 
	
	 Five other seniors who have seen significant playing time are: 
	
	 Wide receiver Brandon Healy of Carlsbad, Calif.; punter Ryan Long of 
Richardson Pearce; offensive tackle Cory Quye of San Antonio Marshall; wide 
receiver Jamel Thompson of Skyline; and safety Joe Walker of Galena Park 
North Shore. 
	
	 Other seniors playing their final game are: 
	
	 Linebacker Scott Emley of San Antonio Churchill and defensive back Marcus 
Walther of Hillcrest. 
	
	
	
	 
	Longhorn Q & A 
	 Q: Can you give us the history behind the Hex Rally? And also, when is it 
this year? 
	 ?? Margot Linney 
	
	 BROWN:  According to the Texas sports information office, the Hex Rally will 
be held Monday, Nov. 20, at 9 p.m. on the university's main mall in front of 
the UT Tower. For years, the Texas-Texas A? game featured bonfires at both 
schools. But the environmentalists won out in Austin, causing the end to the 
bonfire for UT students. In place of the traditional bonfire, Texas turned 
instead to an old story to start a new tradition. In 1941, Texas had not 
beaten Texas A?at Kyle Field since 1923. A group of students turned to an 
Austin fortune teller named Mrs. August Hipple, who gave them the 
prescription for victory. ""Burn red candles,"" she said. The burning of the 
candles, she thought, would show the great support for the team. Texas won, 
23-0, and the red candle legend was born. The candle burning lay dormant 
until 1950, when Texas brought out the candles again the week of the SMU 
game, and the Longhorns upset No. 1 SMU, 23-20. It was back in the boxes for 
the candles after that until 1953, when Texas hosted a Baylor team that was 
unbeaten and seeking its first-ever SWC title. Texas blocked an extra point 
after the first score and won, 21-20. ""The red candles are the most potent 
whammy in Texas tradition and are nothing to be lightly invoked,"" wrote Time 
magazine after the upset. In 1963, Texas was driving for its first unbeaten 
season in modern history, and the possibility of a national championship as 
it hosted Baylor. For three of the previous four years, UT had been in the 
same position - on the verge of a perfect year - only to be upset. Out came 
the red candles one more time, and UT won, 7-0. Bonfires ended in Austin in 
the late 1970s and seeking a new tradition, the ""hex rallies"" were started in 
1986.

	Chris Simms  
	
	Q: So far this season, Chris Simms has thrown five interceptions that were 
returned for touchdowns (if you count the return on the failed two-point 
conversion attempt last week in Kansas). Can you help explain what Chris is 
doing that makes him so vulnerable to this problem? Also, has Chris set a 
school record in this statistic? I enjoy the newsletter. 
	?? Jeff Cookston 
	
	 BROWN:  Chris Simms has had trouble looking off the defense by locking onto 
his intended receiver too early in his drop back. He will look away from his 
intended receiver
	
	but only for a split second. He needs to look off the defense better, and he 
also admits that he must stop trying to force balls into tight coverage. He 
suffers from the same thing that plagued Brett Favre. He sees a receiver in 
double or triple coverage and thinks he has the strength to thread a needle. 
Simms said he saw the double coverage on the pass that was picked off and 
returned for a TD against Kansas. He said he should have thrown it away. He 
said he's learning. He also said that his confidence since coming to Texas is 
at an all-time high. So that's good news for the Longhorns if Simms ends up 
getting the start against Texas A&M. 
	?
	
	
	 Q: I have heard that next year's schedule is just about as weak as this 
year's. Can you either give it to us, or let us know where on the Web to find 
it. 
	?? Steve Davis 
	
	 BROWN:  The 2001 schedule is as follows: Sept. 1, New Mexico State; Sept. 8, 
North Carolina; Sept. 22, at Houston; Sept. 29, Texas Tech; Oct. 6, Oklahoma 
(in Dallas); Oct. 13, at Oklahoma State; Oct. 20, Colorado; Oct. 27, at 
Missouri; Nov. 3, at Baylor; Nov. 10, Kansas; and Nov. 23 or 24, at Texas 
A&M. 
	?
	
	
	 Q: Mack Brown was criticized in the early season for the QB shuffle. To his 
credit, he maintained that two QBs were better than one. At this stage and 
based on Chris Simms' recent games, it would seem to me that Brown was 
correct and did a masterful job of keeping everyone happy with winning five 
games in a row. Also, Brown was able to keep both Major Applewhite and Simms 
motivated. What do you think? 
	?? Charley Davis, Southlake, Texas 
	
	 BROWN:  I think the rotation is now paying off. But I still stand by my 
belief that the rotation slowed down the progress of the offense early in the 
year. Mack Brown said the rotation didn't work as well as it could have 
because this year's team lacked senior leadership. At North Carolina, Brown 
said his QB rotations worked because his teams were older. Anyway, there's no 
doubt that Chris Simms is better off for having played early in the year. And 
Simms is definitely still happy at Texas. No chance of him transferring. 
	?
	
	
	 Q: Can you update us on UT's injuries? 
	?? Ken 
	
	 BROWN:  As of right now, Major Applewhite's right knee sprain is keeping him 
out of practice this week, and he is questionable for the A?game. SS Lee 
Jackson (hamstring) is probable. TE Brock Edwards (leg) and WR Artie Ellis 
(shin) are questionable. DT Stevie Lee (foot) is out and will seek a medical 
redshirt for this season, a move that would give him four years of 
eligibility remaining.

	Q: I'd like an update on recruiting, our commitments, our prospects and how 
you think we will finish. 
	 ?? Matt Dunnahoo 
	
	 BROWN:  Texas has 19 oral commitments with roughly six or seven scholarships 
remaining. There are 10 recruits left who have either been offered a 
scholarship or who are strongly considering Texas. They are: DT Tommie Harris 
of Killeen Ellison; LB Derrick Johnson of Waco; DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, 
Calif.; TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson, both of Galena Park North 
Shore; OL Jamie Hightower of
	
	 Jacksonville; OL William Winston of Houston Madison; S Dwayne Brandon of 
Temple; athlete Quan Cosby of Mart; and DT Paul Brossard of Blinn JC. 
Johnson, Jakes, Moses, Jackson and Brandon are strong Texas leans at this 
point. Most of those players will visit Texas on the weekend of Dec. 15-17, 
the same weekend as the UT football banquet. Texas' 19 oral commitments are 
from the following student-athletes: OL Jonathan Scott (6-7, 290, 4.9) of 
Dallas Carter; OL Abe Robinson (6-6, 270, 4.9), Jersey Village; OL Alfio 
Randall (6-6, 300, 5.1), Blinn JC; OL Mike Garcia (6-5, 280, 5.2), Galena 
Park; OL Will Allen (6-5, 300, 5.2), Cypress Falls; OL Roman Reeves (6-6, 
295, 5.2), Livingston; OL Terrance Young (6-6, 340, 5.5), Longview; QB Matt 
Nordgren (6-5, 225, 4.6), Dallas Bishop Lynch; RB Cedric Benson (5-11, 200, 
4.5), Midland Lee; Anthony Johnson (5-11, 195, 4.4), Jefferson; DE Eric Hall 
(6-2, 240, 4.5), Clarksville, Tenn.; LB Yamil LeBron (6-2, 240, 4.7), Killeen 
Ellison; LB Lance McFarland (6-1, 225, 4.6), Jefferson; DB Cedric Griffin 
(6-1, 180, 4.4), San Antonio Holmes; DB Aaron Ross (6-1, 182, 4.42), Tyler; 
DB Kendal Briles (5-10, 175, 4.5), Wolfforth Frenship; DB Braden Johnson 
(6-2, 200, 4.5), Euless Trinity; DB Brian Carter (5-11, 180, 4.5), The 
Woodlands; P Brian Bradford (6-1, 205), Trinity Valley JC. 
	?
	
	
	 Q: Which bowl do you see UT ending up in? I know that the second-place team 
in the Big 12 goes to the Cotton Bowl. What place would Texas be if we 
defeated A&M? I remember that when A?beat Kansas State a few years ago, 
K-State ended up in the Alamo Bowl and UT played in the Cotton Bowl. Is there 
a chance of a repeat of that if OU beats K-State in the Big 12 championship 
game? 
	?? Mike Thakur 
	
	 BROWN:  If Kansas State beats Oklahoma in the Big 12 title game, there's a 
chance both teams will get into the BCS. Nebraska would then be the likely 
choice for the Cotton Bowl, and the Texas-Texas A?winner would be the likely 
choice for the Holiday Bowl, with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl. But 
there are rumblings that Nebraska isn't excited about the Cotton Bowl and 
would rather go to the Holiday Bowl. That could send the UT-A?winner to the 
Cotton Bowl and the loser to either the Alamo Bowl or the Insight.com Bowl in 
Phoenix, Ariz. If Oklahoma beats Kansas State, the Wildcats would have three 
losses, including one to Texas A&M. That means the Wildcats would probably 
drop to the Insight.com Bowl. And the winner of the UT-A?game would go to 
either the Holiday or the Cotton, with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl. The 
Holiday opponent would be either Oregon or Oregon State. The Alamo opponent 
would likely be Michigan or Ohio State. 
	?
	
	
	 Q: Don't you think Texas has a huge advantage over my Fighting Texas Aggies 
for the following reasons: 1) UT's playing at home; 2) Jason Glenn, Robert 
Ferguson, and Sammy Davis, three of the Aggies' best players, are going to be 
out for the game; and 3) A&M's coming off a demoralizing loss to Oklahoma in 
the biggest game of the year on a national stage. It will be hard to recover 
from that. It looks as if Texas has everything going for it. I believe if 
A?would have beaten Oklahoma, there is not any way Texas beats A?when the Big 
12 south crown is on the line. 
	 ?? Justin S. Schwertner 
	
	 BROWN:  I don't see the Aggies struggling to come back from the Oklahoma 
loss. They played well enough that they probably gained some confidence from 
that game. The bigger setbacks for the Aggies are the loss (or diminished 
ability) of Glenn, Ferguson and Davis. Glenn, the team's sack leader and a 
spirited leader at linebacker, is out for sure with a knee injury that will 
require surgery. If Ferguson, one of the top receivers in the Big 12, and 
Davis, a top cornerback for the Aggies, indeed cannot play, those are big 

"
"hurdles to overcome for A&M. Playing in Austin helps Texas. But this game 
will probably come down to who runs the ball best. Look for this to be a 
showdown between Ja'Mar Toombs and Hodges Mitchell. 
	?
	
	
	
	
	
	
	[IMAGE] 
	Roy Williams  
	
	Q: I thought Roy Williams was good before the Kansas game, but he looked like 
he might have played himself into some postseason awards against the 
Jayhawks. 
	?? Steve Jansen 
	
	 BROWN:  Williams caught four passes for 180 yards - all in the first half. 
Imagine if UT had kept throwing to him in the second half. He did have a 
35-yard reverse for a touchdown (in the second half) for his first rushing TD 
as a Longhorn. But perhaps the
	
	 most amazing stats involving Williams right now are that his seven TD 
receptions this season have averaged 47.6 yards. Five of those TD catches 
came when Texas was behind or tied. The other two came when UT was holding 
narrow three-point and seven-point leads and provided oomph on the way to 
victories. He may end up on some All-Big 12 second teams because Kansas 
State's Quincy Morgan and A&M's Robert Ferguson have been pretty good this 
season. Williams will certainly land on any all-newcomer teams, however. 
Williams ranks first among true freshmen in NCAA Division I-A in receiving 
yards (724), TD catches (7) and yards per catch (20.1). He ranks second 
nationally among true freshmen in receptions per game (36). 
	?
	
	
	 Q: I hate to complain about anything after such a good win, but what's the 
story behind our soft defense on opening drives? It seems that it takes a 
series or two for us to settle in. Is every team we play coming out in some 
strange offense that we haven't seen on film or something? After the first 
drive (adjustments?), we generally shut everyone  down (with a couple of 
obvious exceptions). Why can't we 3-and-out other  teams like they do us on 
opening drives? 
	?? Cody Anderson, Houston 
	
	 BROWN:  Mack Brown has talked all season about how he tells his team to be 
prepared for an opposing team's ""opening surge."" He said he warned his team 
about a possible opening surge by Oklahoma before that game, and sure enough, 
the opening surge became a game-long surge. Warning about the opposing team's 
opening surge has begged the question: Why shouldn't Texas be more concerned 
about creating their own opening surge on both offense and defense? So far, 
the Longhorns have seemed to be prone to the opposing team's ""opening surge"" 
before settling down. 
	?
	
	 Q: Who's fault is it for the drops on short passes from Chris Simms? Is it 
Simms' fault for throwing too hard, or the receivers for not being able to 
catch a ball with zip? 
	?? Lawrence Martin 
	
	 BROWN:  Simms said he is going to start taking something off of those 
passes. He said he doesn't even think about it. He said he just throws it, 
not realizing that some of the those short, dump passes are being thrown with 
the velocity of a Roger Clemens' fastball. Simms said he then walks over to 
the sidelines and hears people saying, ""Can you throw it any harder?"" So look 
for Simms to tone down the heat on some of those short passes. His deep 
passes, however, were phenomenal against Kansas. Just the right zip. 
	?
	
	
	 Q: How long has the Texas-Texas A?game not been played on Thanksgiving? 
	?? Pete Barnes 
	
	 BROWN:  UT and A?have not met on Thanksgiving for seven straight years 
(including this one). The UT-A?game has been hosted 60 times on Thanksgiving 
Day. The last four have been played on the Friday following Thanksgiving. 
Texas is 27-18-3 in non-Thanksgiving Day contests vs. A&M. The last time the 
two teams met on Turkey Day was 1993. 
	?
	
	
	 Q: Someone was telling me that Texas holds the record for players taken in 
the NFL draft, is that right? 
	?? Randall 
	
	 BROWN:  Yes. Texas has had a player drafted in an NFL-record 63 straight NFL 
drafts.

Anyone up for Keneally's after work today?

The potential for freezing rain and hazardous road conditions may be present 
this evening and early tomorrow morning particularly in the northern and 
western parts of the city. Please monitor local news and weather forecasts 
and use your judgement to insure a safe commute. 

The Enron building will be open for business tomorrow, Wednesday, December 
13th. If there should be any change of building status, notice will be given 
on the building hotline and accessible by calling 713-750-5142. 
Once--in March, in Riadosa, NM.  People were literally skiing in tank tops
and shorts.  I heard the slopes at ski apache, where I went, is about 10
times easier than Colorado slopes.  Needless to say, I'm a little nervous
about how well I will do.  But I am extremely excited about going.  When I
did ski before, I was the one in the ski school that everyone was waiting on
because I kept falling, but before I left I made it down all the blues
successfully and one black semi-successfully.  My biggest fear of all is the
cold.  I HATE COLD WEATHER!!  It should be interesting.  On top of it, I'm
extremely excited becase this will be my first vacation I have EVER taken.
Yipppeee!!!

Subject: WINNING TICKET


Dear  State 
Lottery Commission,

??? I know I chose the  
winning numbers for Wednesday's Lotto drawing.? But
upon further  review, 
it appears the incorrect numbers appeared on my
ticket.
How  could this 
happen?? The root cause of this dilemma is the form I  filled
out to get 
my ticket.? The form is very confusing.? I  thought I 
was
choosing
one set of numbers, (the winning numbers), when  in reality I 
chose a
completely different set of numbers.? The  numbers and boxes on 
the form are
so close together, it's impossible to  determine which box to 
fill in for
which number.
??? I  checked with at least 3,000 
other people, and they all had the exact
same  problem.? I'm sure if you 
review the form I filled out, it will  become
very clear that I'm entitled to 
the money from Wednesday's  drawing.? Please
reply with the date, time, 
and location, for me to  collect the winnings due
to me.

Thank you for your assistance in this  
matter.

Speaking of SEC dominance, Brian and I made a 100 dollar bet this weekend.  
Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour"" which 
will be paid for by Brian ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12"" 
Hoskins.

Place and time TBD

Well, the only thing that you have to remember is that between where these
are and SMU it is only about 5 miles apart.  In the SMU area there is the
Doubletree, Marriott Courtyard, Residence Inn.

Here is a more comprehensive list that has phone numbers.  I have stayed at
most of the hotels around there and the most bang for your buck is the
Doubletree.  Not too expensive and pretty nice.

message from George P. Bush provided and paid for by the
Republican National Committee.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                      Election Day, Tuesday, November 7, 2000


  Dear Friend:

  I want to remind you that today is election day.  Our
  generation has a chance to make a difference - to send a
  signal that we want new leaders who trust you, not
  government.  You deserve a government for the 21st century
  -- a government that reflects your values -- your
  entrepreneurial spirit, your trust in initiative, and your
  commitment to leaving behind a better world than you
  inherited.

  Our Republican team would provide that kind of leadership.
  George W. Bush and all of our great Republican candidates
  will focus on results, not daily polls.

  The other side has been running non-stop negative attacks
  against our candidates.  Don't let their fear tactics
  succeed.  Please take your family and friends to the
  polls today and vote for George W. Bush and all of our
  great Republican team.

  Thank you very much.

  George P. Bush


_____________________________________________________________

  LAST CHANCE!

  The polls will close in a few hours.  The Party that best
  gets its voters to the polls will win.  Please forward
  this email to your friends and encourage them to vote.
  Thank you!

Practice tonight at  Memorial Park,  7pm.     Meet at same place as Monday 
night.



IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a split in 
the road with a softball and soccer field on your right hand side, and beck's 
prime on the left..  We will meet at the soccer/softball field for practice. 


If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as the tennis courts...


===


If   you are interested in wagering....   here are some bets that Webb 
Jennings is putting out on the 1 st game.


We spot them:  Total Bet:

9 pts   $50
15 pts   $300
22 pts   $500-$600
30 pts   $1,000

He seems to be extra confident in that he has a former Division 2A 
quarterback... Drew Teamlys  (sp?).

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Charlie Batch , QB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 12/02/00 
 Batch should be able to play next weekend against Green Bay, despite leaving 
Thursday's game against Minnesota.   ""He didn't reinjure his ribs or 
anything,"" team doctor David Collon said. ""It was too sore for him to feel he 
could play effectively, so we just gave up after the first two series.""   
Batch received numbing injections to ease pain in his ribs. Collon said no 
X-rays were necessary.    

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 12/02/00 
 Robinson was released from Northwestern Memorial Hospital on Saturday, three 
days after he was admitted for treatment of back spasms.   Robinson's status 
for Sunday night's game against Green Bay at Soldier Field was downgraded 
from questionable to doubtful. Marty Booker might start in his place, with 
Dez White also seeing increased playing time.    

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00 
 Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time 
to heal. Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth. Coach Mike Martz put 
him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to 
go for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Backup Jeff Hall will remain 
on the active roster until Sunday.   ""I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field 
goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals,"" Wilkins 
said. ""It felt great. I kicked all-out and there were no twinges, no 
tweaks.""     

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/02/00 
 Smith will start at RB at Buffalo this week. He may be a risky start, 
because hamstring injuries sometimes seem to flare up quickly again.  

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/02/00 
 Fiedler will start Sunday at Buffalo. He was sidelined by a pinched nerve in 
his neck on the first play against the New York Jets on Nov. 19. He returned 
to practice Wednesday.   ""Jay looked good today, as he has all week, so he'll 
start,"" coach Dave Wannstedt said following Friday's workout.    

 Dedric Ward , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 12/01/00 
 Ward caught six passes for 93 yards last week against the Bears. His numbers 
were likely helped due to the loss of rookie Laveranues Coles to an injury. 
Look for Ward to see some passes come his way this week against the Colts, as 
Coles will miss his second consecutive game.  Fantasy owners in deeper 
leagues may want to consider starting Ward this week.    

 Rob Johnson , QB BUF - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Johnson is listed as probable on the injury report with sore ribs, but he 
will still start this week's game against the Dolphins. He was knocked out of 
last week's game at Tampa Bay, but threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns 
before exiting. Don't expect big numbers from Johnson this week against 
Miami, whose defense ranks seventh in the league against the pass.     

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Cunningham did not practice on Thursday because of a groin strain. His 
status for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers is uncertain.  The Cowboys 
plan to use third string quarterback Anthony Wright to back up Troy Aikman if 
Cunningham isn't ready to play. At this point in the season, no Dallas 
quarterbacks should be considered for your starting lineup.    

 Panthers , DT CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Not that the Panthers have been a stellar defense for Fantasy owners this 
season, but this week may be a bad time to start Carolina.  The Panthers will 
face a Rams offense that will be pumped up and edgy with the return of QB 
Kurt Warner.  Carolina may get a few interceptions off a rusty Warner but 
look for them to struggle to score Fantasy points against the Rams.  It would 
be wise to use another defense for this week.    

 Martin Gramatica , K TB - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Look for Gramatica to pile up Fantasy points this week as the Bucs score at 
will against the Cowboys.  He is currently seventh in the NFL in scoring.  
Barring injury, he should be one of the top picks among Fantasy kickers next 
year.    

 Buccaneers , DT TB - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Look for the Buccaneers to treat QB Troy Aikman like a tackling dummy this 
Sunday.  The Cowboys have failed to protect him against adequate pass rushes 
this season so don't expect them to do any better against the T.B. sack 
machine.  The Buccaneers will be in Aikman's face all day and will force him 
into some turnovers as well.  Fantasy owners that possess the Bucs' defense 
will see them help their team in a major way this week.    

 Ryan Longwell , K GB - Ramiro Updated 12/01/00 
 Look for Longwell to have a big week against the Bears Sunday.  The Packers 
should have no problems gaining yards against the Bears but they may have 
trouble getting into the end zone, giving Longwell some kicking 
opportunities.  He has been successful when given the opportunity connecting 
on 24-of-28 FGs this season.  Look for him to score some points this week and 
be helpful, as far as Fantasy kickers go.    

 Lions , DT DET - FDIC Updated 12/01/00 
 The Lions' thinned secondary took another hit on Thursday as the team lost 
cornerback Bryant Westbrook for the remainder of the season to a torn left 
Achilles tendon. His loss will force Detroit to move nickel back Marquis 
Walker into the starting lineup.  The pass defense should be alright for the 
rest of the season though.  The pass rush has come alive recently forcing the 
QBs to rush their throws.  Detroit also has a favorable schedule with games 
against the Packers, Jets, and Bears.  Teams whose pass offense has struggle 
considerably this season.     

 Robert Holcombe , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Holcombe will start at fullback Sunday, but he will also get some carries at 
HB.  At this point in the Fantasy season he will be a good reserve back to 
have.  Just in case the Rams decide to rest Marshall Faulk in the upcoming 
weeks.    

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 So far so good for Wilkins and the Rams.  The kicker went through an intense 
kicking workout Thursday without experiencing any pain in his leg.  If he 
continues to kick without experiencing the slightest twinge he will play 
Sunday at Carolina.  Wilkins could be extremely helpful to Fantasy Owners in 
the last few weeks.  The Rams will get QB Kurt Warner back Sunday and face 
the Panthers and Vikings in their next two games.  Look for the offense to 
explode once again and give Wilkins a lot of opportunities to score points.   
 

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/01/00 
 Moore's condition has improved and he has been upgraded to probable for 
Sunday's game against the Broncos.  Moore suffered a stinger against the Rams 
last Sunday and his neck and shoulder have been sore all week.  Give Moore a 
start this Sunday.  He has been an adequate replacement for RB Ricky Williams 
and has been a nice fit behind the Saints' offensive line.      

 Jake Reed , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Reed will practice Friday for the first time since breaking his leg.  He put 
up dismal Fantasy numbers before he injured his leg.  He could be back in 
action before the regular season ends but don't count on him helping out your 
Fantasy team.    

 Aaron Stecker , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Stecker the Bucs' primary kickoff returner sat out of practice Thursday and 
is not expected to play Sunday.  Tampa has activated WR Frank Murphy from its 
practice squad with intentions of having him handle the kicks.  If returners 
are valuable in your Fantasy league it would be wise for you to pick up a 
healthy return man.    

 Macey Brooks , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Brooks missed practice Thursday due to a lower back strain and is 
questionable for Sunday's game against the Packers.  If Brooks doesn't play 
the Bears will only have four healthy receivers.  This could mean a healthy 
diet of running plays.  It would be wise for Fantasy owners to utilize 
Chicago RBs James Allen and Marlon Barnes considering the health of the Bears 
receivers and Green Bay's recent struggles with its run defense.    

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 12/01/00 
 Robinson was hospitalized for back spasms Wednesday night and still remained 
in the hospital Thursday night.  He is also suffering from a lower back 
sprain and is not expected to play against the Packers Sunday.  Marty Booker 
and rookie Dez White will alternate in Robinson's spot.  Eddie Kennison will 
probably be used as the primary receiver.  It would be wise to stay away from 
Robinson and the rest of the Chicago passing team this week.    

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Stewart had a mediocre Fantasy game Thursday carrying 15 times for 67 yards 
and a touchdown.  Look for Stewart to have a better game against the Packers 
next week.  The Packers defensive line is thin without DT Santana Dotson. 
They allowed Carolina rookie Brad Hoover to romp through their front for 117 
yards Monday.     

 Stoney Case , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Case entered Thursday night's game for Detroit, replacing starter Charlie 
Batch who left after re-aggravating a rib injury. Playing for the injured 
Batch, Case completed 23-of-33 passes for 230 yards with one touchdown and 
one interception, and also ran six times for 62 yards. Case might not be a 
bad acquisition at this point of the season. If Batch can't play next week it 
would be best to plug in his backup. Batch may be the better winner, but 
Case's running ability makes him the better Fantasy QB.    

 Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 The rookie wideout put up the best numbers in a game laced with talented 
receivers.  He caught eight passes for 106 yards and a late touchdown.  Don't 
rush out and try to acquire Foster though.  His numbers were probably more a 
product of his chemistry with fellow second-stringer, QB Stoney Case, who 
filled in for the injured Charlie Batch.  Foster seemed to be Case's first 
throwing option.  When Batch returns Foster will probably be the third option 
again.    

 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/01/00 
 Culpepper had a boring Fantasy performance against the Lions Thursday.  He 
threw a touchdown and two interceptions while completing 19-of-32 passes for 
160 yards.  Expect bigger and better numbers for Culpepper when he faces the 
Rams next week in what will probably the biggest offensive explosion of the 
season.      

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Fear Updated 12/01/00 
 Carter caught seven passes for 45 yards Thursday, including a four-yard 
second quarter touchdown for his 1,000th career  catch.  It was a milestone 

"
"night for Carter but a forgettable one for Fantasy owners.  His numbers 
weren't too spectacular.  Look for him to put up better numbers against the 
Rams and their generous defense next week.    

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/01/00 
 The Lions managed to put the clamps on the star wideout Thursday.  He was 
held to 26 yards on three catches.  Don't worry Fantasy owners.  If your team 
is still in the playoff hunt Moss will make up for his performance next week 
against the Rams.  He is just too talented to be shut down in consecutive 
games.      

 Robert Smith , RB MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/01/00 
 Smith ran for two touchdowns and 117 yards on 17 carries Thursday night, 
including a 43-yard fourth-quarter TD run that sealed the game for 
Minnesota.  If you have Smith on your Fantasy team he may very well seal a 
Fantasy championship for your team.  He is without a doubt the hottest 
Fantasy back right now.    

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 Although McNair is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury report for 
Sunday's game in Philadelphia, he is expected to get the start. His thumb is 
still sore and he's been icing it regularly, but it's not expected to keep 
him from playing. Still, the Eagles have a solid defense and the Titans' 
passing game has struggled of late, so you might want to consider starting 
someone else this week.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 George did not practice yesterday in order to rest his injured right big 
toe, although he and Coach Jeff Fisher said he could have participated. 
Fisher wants George to be able to fully participate in today's session, and 
expects he will be able to. Considering George has held up this well through 
a variety of injuries in recent weeks, there's little reason to expect he 
won't start Sunday in his return to Philadelphia and post solid Fantasy 
numbers.  

 Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Ward is listed as probable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game 
against Oakland. With Pittsburgh's receivers hurting, expect him to play and 
be the focus of the passing game. He's still marginal as a Fantasy producer, 
though.

Grab Gus Frerotte!
?
As a followup to our followup today on Griese,  ESPN's John Clayton has 
more.? He's reporting that backup QB Gus Frerrotte  has been told he needs to 
be ready to play for the rest of the season.?  
?
Don't panic yet as it'll be a couple of days still  before they know exactly 
what they're dealing with. But the bottom line is this  seems to be getting 
worse by the minute.
?
I'm not a?huge Frerotte fan but if he winds up  starting, he'll be handed the 
keys to one of the more prolific offenses in the  league.? Between Mike 
Shanahan and Offensive Coordinator Gary Kubiak,  that's a great brain trust.? 
A healthy Terrell Davis, 2 great WRs and 3 TEs  that are all effective make 
for a nice system.
?
We'll stay on this for you.
?
Joe
?
?
Here's the full article from ESPN's Clayton for  more detail.? 
http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1114/877559.html?? 
?
While not issuing an update on the injury Tuesday,  the Denver Broncos were 
fearful enough of losing quarterback Brian Griese because of his separated  
throwing shoulder that they told backup Gus Frerotte to be ready to play the  
rest of the season, ESPN.com's John Clayton reported.
?
Griese's injury is officially listed as a separated  AC joint. The Broncos 
said Tuesday they aren't likely to know about their  quarterback's 
availability for Sunday's game against San Diego until later in  the week. 

Griese was injured in the first quarter of  Denver's 27-24 win over Oakland 
on Monday night, but he returned to the lineup  and helped engineer the 
victory. 

""We won't know for a couple of days the exact  extent of the injury,"" coach 
Mike Shanahan said. ""We'll wait to see how sore he  is."" 

Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said Griese could be out  a ""significant period of 
time,"" adding, ""It looks bad."" 

Asked after the game if he expected to play  against the Chargers, Griese 
said, ""I don't know. I can't tell you what's going  to happen, what my 
availability will be for next week. I've never had an injury  like this, but 
I'm going to do my best to come back and play."" 

Griese already was playing with torn cartilage in  the same shoulder, which 
will require off-season surgery. He insisted the two  injuries are unrelated.

Subject: FW: Aggies Demand a Recount

College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31. ""The end
zones were confusing,"" says Slocum. ""I'm sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.

We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored
thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M demands a recount.""

Oklahoma officials are calling this ""outrageous"". ""They agreed to the size,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off,"" replies OU coach
Bob Stoops.  ""If they had a problem with them, they should have said so
before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with the
outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five points many
times.""

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  ""We
are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner of
the game,"" says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones
were used. ""They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,""
says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as, ""A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!"" Students' thoughts echoed
their signs. ""All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare a
winner,"" says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.

""We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a
winner.""

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,
despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point. At about 2:30
pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC had to back off its
prediction.

College football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. ""We felt that with a
number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we were
certain A&M would carry this game. We may have been premature in our
prediction.""

In October of this year, we asked you to participate in the &Pulse8 survey.  
Over 70% of you were willing to take the time to respond.  Thank you!  This 
is our highest response to an all Enron employee survey - ever.  

In exchange for your candid feedback, we want to provide you with an overview 
of the results for our company.

We realize that you and your management have been working hard to build on 
our strengths and improve in areas of concern for us.  The results reflect 
your substantial efforts.

As you can see from the chart below, thanks to the increased focus on these 
issues provided by the Vision & Values Task Force and your efforts to improve 
communications, we have made significant progress.

the company should enable better performance from all of us.  However, as you 
know, our goal is to have 60% positive in most of these areas by 2001.  So 
our work is not over and these will continue to be areas of attention. 
(Complete survey results are attached for your review.)

Hi Folks,

First off, congratulations  on a great season.I assume if you,re  still in 
the hunt this late in the year, you have to call 2000 a successful  
campaign.? Enjoy it.? It,s an intense time and you can,t slack  off now but 
it,s also important to enjoy the moment regardless of what happens  in the 
next few weeks.? It,s tough  enough just to get to this point.?  Great work!

From my perspective it,s  interesting in that the actual number of folks who 
read the material drops way  off this time of year.? But the  other side of 
the coin is that the interest level of the ones still reading  shoots through 
the roof.? There may  not be as many folks reading as there were in 
September, but the ones that are  here are into in a big way!???

I,ll do my dead level best  to keep up my end of the bargain and provide the 
best info I can all the way to  the week 17 games.? Lets get at  it.?

Joe

??

Matchups to Avoid and Exploit.?  

Passing Game  Matchups.?? Here's how I see the matchups this  week.? Please 
note, see the  cheatsheet online (will be available?late Wednesday evening 
at?http://www.cheatsheets.net/week14sheet.htm?  ) ?for exactly where I rank 
players and to determine who to start.? Just because one matchup may be more  
favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player 
with  the best matchup.? The matchup info  is meant to be just one more tool 
in your box when it comes to deciding between  players.?? 

Note:? I,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last four 
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mike 
Hall,s excellent FLM League Management Software.? http://www.fflm.com/ for 
more info.? The Fantasy Points Allowed by Position  numbers are from 
ESPN.com.?  

?

Here we go:

Locks:? These games heavily favor the Offense  

New Orleans Passing Game  vs Bronco Defense???? I stuck my neck out a  bit 
last week with QB Aaron Brooks but he came though for me.? This week, he 
draws a great matchup with  a Denver defense that,s not been able to stop 
anyone through the air.? Over the last four weeks, they rank # 31  in passing 
yards allowed per game.?  Denver has averaged giving up 308 yards passing per 
game over that  span.? With CB Ray Crockett out with  a torn hamstring, Jimmy 
Spencer will fill in for him again this week.? He and Terrell Buckley can 
definitely be  beaten. Brooks will focus on WR Joe Horn, his primary weapon 
but  Willie Jackson refuses to fade away and is a solid option.? RB Chad 
Morton catches the ball  pretty well out of the backfield.?  TE Aaron Glover 
still is total non factor for Fantasy  purposes.? I'm doing my best to not 
get  carried away with Brooks.? Keep telling yourself the young man has 
exactly  2 games of NFL experience.? On the other hand, there comes a time 
when you  take a leap and go with what you see with your own eyes.? This guy 
isn't  playing like a 2 game rookie and the Denver defense is awful.?  

St. Louis Passing Game vs  Carolina Defense?? I want to believe.? I believe 
in Kurt  Warner and I believe he,ll get his Rams back on track.? As much as 
anything, I believe you,ll  see Marshall Faulk at least see more action than 
he saw last  week.? Warner,s an MVP but I think  it,s Faulk that makes this 
team go.?  He creates so much havoc with the defense that must either commit  
safeties to support the run which then opens the passing game.? If the 
defense plays the pass, then  Faulk can kill them with the run or short 
passes.? After last week, I,d be shocked if coach  Mike Martz doesn,t get 
back to utilizing?his?star RB?more.? Kurt Warner makes his return and I,m  
guessing he picks up where he left off.?  That,s not what you,d expect to 
happen but Warner,s made a career of  exceeding expectations.? If he,s on  
your roster, I think you have to go with him.? Especially against this 
defense.? Carolina ranks # 30 in passing yards  allowed per game over the 
last four weeks.?  For WRs, it,s always tough to pick.?  Isaac Bruce and 
Torry Holt are the sure guys but honestly, Ricky Proehl,s  been on fire 
lately.? Az-Zahir Hakim  is always worth a shot too.? Any one  of these guys 
can go off.? TE Roland  Williams suffers with so many good receivers but he,s 
a decent producer  too.

Atlanta Passing Game vs  Seattle Defense?? This one is a pure matchup play 
as  Dan Reeves makes the move for starting?QB Doug Johnson over the  fading 
Chris Chandler.? I,m not a  big fan of either but if you find yourself faced 
with the prospect of starting a  Falcon QB, this is the week to do it if you,
re ever going to.? The Seahawks defense is less like a hawk  and more like an 
albatross around Mike Holmgren,s neck.? They,re awful.? Over the last four 
weeks, they rank # 29  in passing yards allowed per game.?  Good luck picking 
the WR as Terrance Mathis has been  invisible lately while Shawn Jefferson is 
making a  resurgence.? A few weeks ago, it was  Mathis who was hot while 

"
"Jefferson faded.?  If you made me pick one, I,d reluctantly go with 
Jefferson.? TE Reggie Kelly did  catch 3 passes Sunday but I,m not counting 
on him for too  much.

Pittsburgh Passing Game  vs Raider Defense?? Kor-DELL(Kor-DELL(Kor-DELL??? 
What brought this guy back  to life?? I dunno but you can bet  coach Bill 
Cowher is going to do everything he can to keep it rolling.? Kordell Stewart 
looks to be  playing with renewed confidence and we all know that so much of 
the game at this  level is mental.? No one ever  doubted his physical 
skills.? The  obvious spark seems to have been the benching of WR Plaxico  
Burress and the inspired play of Hines Ward.? I think it,s ironic that Ward 
was very  much a Kordell-like &Slash8 player in college at Georgia.? Bobby 
Shaw is getting into the  act and producing from the WR slot and wonders of 
wonders, TE Mark  Bruener caught a TD Sunday.? You  know things are changing 
when Bruener gets in the endzone.? The Raiders are an extremely good  
football team but stopping teams through the air is their Achilles  heel.

Cincinnati Passing Game  vs Cardinal Defense?? Another interesting aspect of  
writing this column late in the season is that you can almost guess which  
players to talk about as most Fantasy Teams still interested in December are  
stocked with the obvious stars.?  QB Scott Mitchell likely doesn,t fall into 
that &star8  category and I doubt many folks are faced with the decision to 
start him this  week but if he,s your best QB, this might be your lucky 
week.? First of all, let,s assume he gets the  knee ready to go.? This early 
in the  week, that,s honestly a shaky assumption.?  We,ll know more later.? 
But  if he can go, he could do some damage against an awful Cardinal 
defense.? WR Peter Warrick could be a  decent play too although Aeneas 
Williams is a solid cover guy.? He,s hard to count out though just  because 
of his home run ability.?  Funny how I don,t see many people complaining 
about his 40 times  now(? RB Corey Dillon is the  only other starter on this 
team but we,ll catch up with him in the rushing  Matchups.

?

Prime Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense?

Arizona Passing Game vs  Bengal Defense?? Let,s be clear, I,m no Jake  
Plummer fan but the truth of the matter is he,s got a pretty decent matchup  
this week.? He,s reportedly making  good progress and should start Sunday.?  
Partly because, he,s better, partly because Dave Brown was just  awful.? 
&Worse than Plummer8 has a  nasty ring to it(? But this Bengal  pass defense 
is pretty bad.? Over  the past four weeks, they rank # 26 in passing yards 
allowed  per game.? WRs David Boston has the physical  tools to do some 
damage and Frank Sanders has the experience to make an  impact.? Remember, 
this is the unit  that made Pittsburgh look like the 1999 Rams last week.???

New York Jets Passing  Game vs Colts Defense?? The Jets have been up and down 
a  bit but this week they could make some noise against a struggling 
Indianapolis  defense.? The pathetic Colt pass  rush only has 4 sacks in the 
last 4 games.?  QB Vinny Testeverde had a decent day in their last matchup 
with  271 yards and 1 TD.? WR Wayne  Chrebet,s been in a funk lately but in 
their week he went off catching 8  passes for 140.? Sure some of it was  
late, but garbage stats count too.?  Dedric Ward caught just 54 yards worth 
of passes but he scored in  that game.? He,s come on lately  after fading 
early. Rookie WR Laveranues Coles will miss another game it  appears. RB 
Curtis Martin still is struggling to get 100% healthy  and that will hurt a 
little.? TE  Anthony Becht is a bright spot as he,s beginning to contribute.? 
December in New York will make a  difference to this soft Colt team which 
doesn,t play as well in the  cold.?

Detroit Passing Game vs  Viking Defense?? Charlie Batch continued to  look 
good and went a good ways toward erasing some of his (well deserved)  
candybone label with a gutsy performance on Thanksgiving.? His ribs are 
reportedly better and he  had a nice practice Tuesday throwing the ball.?? 
The Viking secondary could have  matchup troubles with WRs Johnnie Morton and 
Herman Moore.? Over the last four weeks, Minnesota  ranks # 24 in passing 
yards allowed  per game.? For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy  Points 
allowed to opposing QBs.? The  Vikings are tough on TEs ranking # 7 in 
Fantasy Points allowed to TEs for the  year but TE David Sloan has played 
very well of late.? He ranks # 6 in Fantasy Points among TEs  over the last 3 
games and is well worth a start here.

Denver Passing Game vs Saints Defense??  For all the hype generated by New 
Orleans, defense, they give up tons of  yards passing.? Over the last four  
weeks, they rank # 23 in passing yards allowed  per game.? They do sack the 
QB a ton (19 over the  last four weeks) but they still give up the yards. It,
s kind of unusual to see  that. They,ll be facing Gus Frerotte and a Denver 
team that,s trying to  find their way.? Frerotte,s been up  and down after 
his monster week 12 game.?  The Saints continue to drop like flies and the 
loss of CB Fred Weary will  definitely hurt.? Both WRs Rod  Smith and Ed 
McCaffrey are solid plays as always.? And as crazy as it sounds, either one 
of  the 2 headed TE monster in Dwayne Carswell and Desmond? Clark are decent 
options too.? Byron Chamberlain  normally makes it a 3 headed TE monster but 
he,s nursing a bad Achilles tendon  and didn,t play last week.? As noted  
above, Denver gives up lots of yards through the air so this could be a high  
scoring affair.? I doubt you could  have predicted a shootout between Aaron 
Brooks and Gus Frerotte 4 months ago but  that,s why they play the games(

?

?

Even  Matchups:? These games feature no  real advantage either way?

Chicago Passing Game vs Packer  Defense??  I,m torn  here.? You probably saw 
how weak the  Packer defense looked Monday night.?  They couldn,t do much of 
anything.?  But on the other hand, the Bears will likely go with Shane 
Matthews and  he,s been just awful lately.? Like  worse than Dave Brown kind 
of bad.?  One would think he,d improve against this defense but he,ll have to 
make  great strides just to get reach &average8. ?Owners of WR Marcus  
Robinson feel it too as the big guy has pretty much disappeared lately  with 
Matthews at the helm.? Still  though, there,s some hope.? On a  brighter 
spot, Matthews does seem comfortable throwing to Eddie  Kennison who had 6 
passes thrown to him Sunday compared to Robinson,s  4.? I,ve hear rumors that 
Chicago  may start a TE but that news is unconfirmed at this time(? In the 
""for  real"" rumor department, QB Cade McNown is making noise about  wanting 
to start this week but I think it's still a week  early.

New  England Passing Game vs Chief Defense?? Kansas City and New England are  
two once proud teams that are struggling.?  This week a banged up Drew  
Bledsoefaces a pass  defense that,s been vulnerable.?  Over the last four 
weeks, Kansas City ranks # 20  in  passing yards allowed per game.? For the 
year,? KC ranks # 24 in Fantasy Points allowed  to opposing QBs. Bledsoe 
bruised a knee in Thursday,s game but played through it  and should be ok.? 
Keep an eye on  him though as he was added to the injury report this week as 
Questionable. As  long as Bledsoe plays, WR Terry  Glennshould be a good  
option as he,s clearly the #1 guy in that offense over  Troy  Brown.? TE Rod 
Rutledge  caught 4 passes  last week so he may start to make some noise.? 
With all those productive years throwing  to Ben Coates, you know Bledsoe 
would love to have a solid  TE.



Carolina Passing Game vs Rams  Defense?? Even if you want to pin Carolina,s  
Monday Night performance on a weak Green Bay defense, credit still must be 
given  to Steve  Beuerleinand the  Panthers.? The immobile Beuerlein  hung in 
there and delivered.? He,s  facing a Rams defense that even with Bud Carson,s 
help, still ranks # 19  in  passing yards allowed per game.? (Granted, that,s 
a big improvement)? Beuerlein,s numbers may be helped by the  return of Ram 
QB Kurt Warner as there,s nothing like the other team rolling up  points to 
get your QB,s arm loose.?  WR  Muhsin Muhammad had the dominating  game we 
all know he can and looked overpowering.? The hamstring injury was supposed 
to be  with him all year but he looks good to me.?  Another boost for 
Beuerlein will be if WR Donald  Hayescan get back on  the field as early 
reports are hoping for.?  Even TE Kris  Mangum(be the one guy  in your league 
that doesn,t say &mag-num8 like the gun) has been looking  good.? For the 
year, St. Louis ranks  # 28 in Fantasy Points allowed to the TE so he could 
be worth a shot.???

Jacksonville Passing Game vs Browns  Defense?? This one really is a case of  
misdirection as QB Mark  Brunellisn,t as good as  many people think and the 
Browns pass defense isn,t as bad as most people  assume.? Cleveland ranks # 
18  in  passing yards allowed per game.? And for the year, they rank # 6 in  
Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs which really surprises people.? The 
reason is that their rush defense is  awful and teams choose to run instead.? 
 But all you really care about are the stats.? Brunell should be ok but not 
great here  as the Jaguars look to take out a season,s worth of frustrations 
on the  Browns.?  Jimmy  Smithand  Keenan  McCardellare solid choices  as 
usual.? Even the much maligned  (by me, anyway) rookie R. Jay  Sowardproduced 
last  week.? Soward could actually be bad  news for McCardell and Smith as 
there were times when Brunell really seemed to  force the ball his way.?  TE  
Kyle Bradyis solid.? But honestly, I think this will be the  Fred Taylor on 
the ground show against a weak rush  unit.?

Washington Passing Game vs Giant  Defense?? Brad  Johnsonmakes his return  
this week taking over for Jeff George.?  It,s interesting to watch how the 
Redskins spin this transition.? According to Washington, Johnson  starting 
has nothing to do with Jeff George,s less than spectacular play or  record.? 
&Johnson was the starter  all along regardless of how George played yada 
yada(8? This type of talk makes it easier to  sell the fans Jeff George as 
the starting QB next year.? We,ll see.? (for the record, I,m a George fan 
and  have been for a while.? Myself and 8  other guys are pretty much it()??  
Like most players in this &could go either way8 category, Johnson has  good 
and bad points this week.? On  the upside, the Giants defense has shown 
itself to be vulnerable to the  pass.? The Redskins also hope to  have RB  
Stephen Davisthis week.? His presence does a great deal for the  passing 
game.? On the downside,  Johnson will likely be rusty.? He  may still be 
feeling some lingering effects of the injury.? Secondly, his best  WR,  
Albert Connellmay play but he,s  nowhere near full speed.?  James  
Thrashfilled in  admirably for Connell and looks to be a good play this week 
as well.? It looks like  Irving  Fryarwill get the  start opposite Thrash.? 
The ageless  wonder might do something if Jason Sehorn stays with Thrash as 
Dave Thomas is by  far the weaker CB.?  TE  Stephen Alexanderis a steady  
performer although FB Larry  Centerssteals too many  of the short passes that 
could go to Alexander.?

New  York Giant Passing Game vs Redskin Defense? A good defense takes on a 
good passing  offense.? I guess that,s why this  matchup is in this column.? 
Over the  last four weeks Washington ranks # 15 in  passing yards allowed per 
game.? For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy  Points allowed to opposing QBs 
so they,re pretty tough.? QB Kerry  Collinshas quietly  played extremely well 
over the last month.?  He,s thrown for 822 yards and 6 TDs over the last 3 
games.? That puts him at # 6 in Fantasy Points  among QBs over that time 
span.?  WR  Amani Toomercontinues to play  great football and is definitely 
worth a shot.? Joe  Jureviciusfills in for the  injured Ike Hilliard again 
and he,s a solid choice as Collins didn,t hesitate to  throw him the ball 
often.?  TE? Pete Mitchell  is tough to depend  on as he gets more catches 
but Dan  Campbellgrabs the TDs it  seems.? I,m not too excited about  either 
guy.?

San  Diego Passing Game vs 49er Defense?? My Charger buddies have cautioned  
me about jumping on the Ryan LeafBandwagon.? That was right after I,d sent a 
group  email at halftime of the SD / KC game to some friends boasting about 
&my8 QB  Leaf.? Of course, we know the  nd half didn,t go &quite8 as well as 
the first and I came back to  reality.? But there,s some truth to  the idea 
Leaf is becoming an NFL QB.?  I personally had doubts if we,d ever see it but 
I think it,s starting to  happen.? And this week against a San  Francisco 
defense, he could make some more strides.? It should be noted, the 49ers are 
much  better on pass defense than they had been.?  Over the last four weeks, 
they rank # 14 in passing yards allowed per  game which is a huge upgrade 
from where they had been.? For the year though, they still rank #  30 in 
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB.? Leaf has some extremely solid 
receivers.  TE  Freddie Jonesis his best  target but veteran WRs Jeff Graham 
and Curtis  Conwayare more than  capable.? You,d think that San  Francisco 
will score some points so there could be some fireworks.? I,d shy away from 
Leaf but Jones in  particular could be a very nice play.???

San Francisco  Passing Game vs Charger Defense? The Charger defense held 
Kansas City  down last week but I think that had more to do with Warren Moon,
s senior citizen  status than it did the Charger D.?  Granted they,re 
improving, but I think San Francisco should be able to  move the ball.? Over 
the last four  weeks, San Diego ranks # 13 in passing yards allowed per 
game.? QB Jeff Garciais coming off a bye week and  should be rested and 
prepared.? His  biggest problem will be the toe injury to WR Terrell Owens.? 
Owens was unable to complete practice  Monday and it,s now looking like it 
could be later this week before he sees the  practice field.? Coach Steve  
Mariucci didn,t sound too optimistic.?  Although I can imagine worse 
scenarios for a WR than having  Jerry  Riceas your best WR.? Owens will 
definitely be missed but  J.J.  Stokesand  Tai  Streetswill fill in just 
fine.? There had been some talk from Mariucci  about resting Garcia to see 
how the rookie QBs Gio Carmazzi and Tim Rattay would  fare in game 
situations.? I think  this is just talk at this point.? I  don,t really see 
the Chargers blowing out San Francisco to the point Garcia  could be pulled.? 
If Garcia gets San  Francisco such a lead that he could be pulled, he would 
have probably earned a  great day of stats by then anyway.?  At least for 
this week, I,m thinking he,ll be fine in the playing time  department.?

Minnesota Passing  Game vs Lion Defense? Ok, this is tough matchup for the  
Vikings.? Detroit ranks # 6 in passing yards allowed per gameover the last 
four  games.? But the Lions are dealing  with several injuries in their 
secondary including Safety Ron Rice (leg )  probable) Kurt Schulz 
(ankle-doubtful) and nickel back Marquis Walker  (wrist-out)? Still though, 
you,re  crazy if you don,t start QB Daunte Culpepperand  WRs Randy  Mossand  
Cris  Carter.? They,re just too  good.?

Kansas  City Passing Game vs Patriot Defense?? It,s early to make a call but 
it,s  looking like QB Elvis  Grbacwill be back this  week.? That,s great news 
for Chief  fans and Fantasy Owners.? The  Patriots rank # 10 in passing yards 
allowed per game over the last four weeks  but those numbers are a little 
skewed as Detroit, Cincinnati, Cleveland and  Buffalo were the opponents.? 
It,s  not like they shut down the Rams or 49ers.?  Grbac will look to get his 
# 1 target TE Tony  Gonzalezback on track  after he was shut out by the 
Chargers.?  I don,t think you,ll see that again with Grbac under center.? WR 
Derrick  Alexanderis an excellent  target too.? Rookie  Sylvester  
Morrisseems to be  fading instead of getting better.?  He may be hitting the 
infamous &rookie wall8.? 

?

Downside Matchups:? These games favor the  Defense?

Dallas  Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense?? Emmitt Smith seems recovered 
from  his &knockout slap8 Thursday and says he,ll start.? That,s good news 
for all aspects of the  Dallas offense.?  QB  Troy Aikmansquares off  against 
a Tampa defense that's bark is worse than its bite.? Over the last four 
weeks, they rank # 21  in  passing yards allowed per game.? Although they 
have registered 12 sacks  over that span which is towards the top of the 
league.? They,re solid though.? WRs Wayne  McGarityand  James  McKnightare 
showing  they,re not anything exceptional.?  TE  Jackie Harriswas injured 
last  week and David  LaFluerwoke up with a  great game.???

Cleveland Passing Game vs Jaguar  Defense?? One has to ask if anyone really  
cares whether QBsDoug  Pedersonor  Spergon  Wynngets the majority  of the 
snaps.? I think I can say  fairly confidently that neither of these guys have 
been figuring heavily into  your plans.? The Jaguar defense has  improved 
significantly of late. ?They rank # 17  in  passing yards allowed per 
gameover the last  four weeks and they should be plenty good enough to 
contain the Browns.? This team never really had a chance once  Tim Couch and 
Errict Rhett went down.?  Kevin  Johnsonand  David  Patten handle the WR  
duties but I can,t advocate either with a clear conscience.  TE  AaronShea
will start for  the Browns but probably not for your FF Team.?

Green  Bay Passing Game vs Bear Defense?? It,s hard to know what to think  
about Green Bay. One game they look like the Packers of old with Favre 
working  his magic and the next, they look like a shell of their former 
selves as they  did on Monday Night against a Carolina team that had no 
business handling them  as they did.?  Brett  Favreis still a decent  bet to 
sling a few TDs on any Sunday but he,s sadly become just an average  Fantasy 
QB.? Lately, the Bears have  been tough against the pass ranking # 12 in 
passing yards allowed per game over  the last four weeks.? Although for  the 
year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB.? Favre 
will have the very disappointing  Antonio  Freemanto throw to  although Bill  
Schroederis putting up  better numbers the last few weeks.?  He has another 
advantage in that while Freeman will likely draw CB Thomas  Smith, Schroeder 
likely goes against Jerry Azumah.? Remember Schroeder came up huge in the  
week 5 matchup with 2 TDs in the 4th quarter.? For a TE, I,d go with  Bubba  
Franksalthough whenever  I say that it seems Tyrone  Daviscatches a  TD(?

Seattle Passing Game vs Falcon  Defense?? This is an interesting game as two  
proud coaches in Dan Reeves and Mike Holmgren lead teams that are  
floundering.? The one bright spot  for the Falcons is that they,ve yielded 
few yards passing although the &glass is  half empty8 crowd will point out 
that the reason for that is the weak rush  defense.? Why throw the ball when  
you can run on Atlanta?? Regardless  of the reason, teams don,t throw much 
against the Falcons and I don,t look for  QB Jon Kitnato  completely break 
that trend.? He,ll  be looking to quiet producers Sean Dawkinsand Derrick 
Mayes.?  Dawkins in particular has been exceptional over the last few weeks 
and is  probably worth a start.????

Indianapolis Passing  Game vs Jets Defense?? I love  Peyton  Manningbut he,s 
a guy that doesn,t  always post the Fantasy Football numbers to match his 
hype.? He,s a solid producer who,ll very rarely  burn you but he,s also not 
too subject to the 400 yard / 4 TD day.? With that said, I think you,ll see  
another good, solid day from him against a Jet defense that,s tough.? Over 
the last four weeks, New York ranks  # 11 in passing yards allowed per game.? 
 For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  QB.? 
Manning will try to jump start  his team that,s floundering a bit.?  They 
know they need a win and a team like this can be tough when  &cornered8.? I,m 
not heeding the  grumblings about WR  Marvin Harrison. He,s fine.? He caught 
2 TDs last week and has stated  he needs to &get on a mission8 although he 
needs some help.? Jerome Pathonhad some horrendous drops.? E.G. Greenhopes to 
be back this week from  a knee injury and that will be good news.?  Terrence 
Wilkins and Pathon just aren,t getting it done.? TEs Marcus Pollardand  Ken  
Dilgerboth catch just enough to make  neither guy very valuable.




"
"Oakland Passing Game  vs Steeler Defense?? QB Rich Gannonis garnering lots of 
talk about  the league MVP.? Could be.? But  he,s got a tough matchup this 
week against a Steeler team playing with  confidence.? Pittsburgh ranks # 8 
in  passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? For the season, 
they rank # 2 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing QB so that,s 
strong.? WRTim Brownis the clear cut target of  choice and that makes things 
great for Brown owners.? You know he,ll get his touches.? Andre Risonand  
James  Jettwill get the scraps left  over.? TE Ricky Dudleyis a guy who you 
play totally  at your own risk.? He,s just as  liable to go catchless as he 
is score 2 TDs.???

?

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense



Miami  Passing Game vs Bills Defense?  Let,s  see(Jay  Fiedlercoming back 
from  a shoulder injury, in what will likely be horrible weather conditions, 
against  the # 2 ranked defense in passing yards allowed per game over the 
last four  weeks.? That,s what you,ve got in  this game and it,s enough to 
have me looking elsewhere if I,ve got Dolphin  passing game players.? I,d 
start who  ever you did last week if Fiedler is your QB.? If you have to 
start a Miami WR, I,d  roll the dice on the unheralded Leslie  Shepherdwho,s 
catching  more than anyone thought he would.?  Slim pickings with this 
matchup after that.?

Buffalo Passing Game vs Dolphin  Defense?? Let,s  see(Rob  Johnsoncoming back 
from  his latest injury, in what will likely be horrible weather conditions, 
against  the # 3 ranked defense in passing yards allowed per game over the 
last four  weeks.? This sounds familiar(? Seriously, this game ought to be a  
defensive struggle as two dominant defenses square off in the snow against  
mediocre offenses.? Rob Johnson will  get the start but as usual, won,t 
finish the game.? Eric  Mouldswill gather the  majority of catches and is 
probably too good not to start just because he,s so  talented and he does 
grab the lions share of passes thrown.? TE Jay  Reimersmais fast regaining  
his place as one of the best TEs in the game and depending on the weather 
here,  he could be the best receiving choice.???

Philadelphia Passing Game vs Titan  Defense?? Understand that this is a bad  
matchup for Donovan McNabband the Eagles but so was last week against  
Washington.? And all McNabb did was  win Offensive Player of the Week 
honors.?  Outside of McNabb and TE Chad Lewis, I can,t recommend any other 
players as  starters.? Neither  WRsCharles  Johnsonor Torrance  Smallscare 
anyone.? The Titans are an athletic and physical  unit that you,d think would 
give McNabb trouble. And truthfully, the Washington  game would have likely 
been different if ""spy"" LaVarr Arrington hadn't been hurt  early.? The lack 
of a passing game threat really hurts as Tennessee will  likely be able to 
handle the WRs with man coverage and commit more personnel to  the run and 
McNabb.? Still, if he,s  by far your best QB, I,d roll the dice with him as 
he,s made a season out of  proving people wrong.



Tennessee Passing Game vs Eagle  Defense?? Steve  McNairranks # 23 among QBs  
over the last 3 games in Fantasy Points per game.? That,s not real solid.? I 
don,t see him suddenly improving his  play against an Eagle defense that 
ranks # 5 in passing yards allowed per  game.? And for the year, they rank #  
3 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB.?? The Eagles have 15 sacks 
over the  last 4 games and while McNair is tough guy to sack, it,s obvious 
the Eagles will  pressure him.? His WR corps in  Derrick Masonand  Chris 
Sandersaren,t  the greatest.? As usual, his best  option will be TE Frank 
Wycheck.?  Wycheck struggled last week with some uncharacteristic drops, but 
this  week he could be an asset as McNair likely won,t have a lot of time to  
throw.?  

Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Cowboy  Defense?? Who knows where the  Shaun  
KingRoller Coaster  Ride will take us this week?? He,s  nursing a back strain 
but practiced Wednesday and looks good to go.? The Cowboys surprisingly have 
played  decent pass defense ranking # 9 in passing yards allowed per game.? 
Of course, that,s largely because no  team feels the need to throw the ball 
when they can run at will.? King will spread the ball between  WRs  Keyshawn 
Johnsonand  Jacquez  Green.? I,m not especially excited about either  but it,
s very hard to turn your back on Keyshawn.? TE Dave  Mooreis a fine  producer 
and I,d feel comfortable starting him.?

Controversy Rages Over Democratic Effort to Suppress Military
Absentee Ballots

 ""...I happen to believe that, the military personal who sent
 their ballots in, should be allowed and should be counted...
 And I think we should look into it,  because we realize that
 when some of those ballots were sent off, many times the
 aircraft or the other vehicle utilized to transport them had
 to get on and they had to leave without the post marks. So I
 think the military should have some latitude in allowing
 those individuals to vote....""
     - Sheila Jackson Lee, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00

 ""...if he wins he is going to be Commander and Chief, I
 think he [Gore] ought to weigh into this and say, 'I really
 want this straightened out because it is only fair and right
 to do that.'""
     - David Gergen, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00

 ""I mean, here we are -- a week ago, we were having the
 groundbreaking for the World War II Memorial, we were all
 praising veterans and servicemen. This week, President
 Clinton is in Vietnam talking about reconciliation, and it
 all involves veterans and all involves active duty service
 personnel. And it seems to me that just in fairness...I
 think the general statement ought to be, 'Let's make every
 effort to count these ballots.'""
     - Bob Dole, NBC's Meet the Press, 11/19/00

 Tim Russert: ""Will you today, as a representative of the
 Gore campaign, ask every county to relook at those ballots
 that came from armed services people and waive any so-
 called irregularities or technicalities which would
 disqualify them?""

 Senator Joseph Lieberman: ""I don't know that I have that
 authority.  I don't believe I do legally or in any other
 way.""

""These are the real questions now facing the nation.

""Everything else is clutter.

""Friday afternoon, Gore strode purposefully to a bank of
microphones outside the vice-presidential mansion in
Washington and said:

""'The American people want to make certain that every vote
counts and that every vote is counted fairly and accurately.'""

""So far, so good.

""Then came word that Gore campaign operatives, armed with a
detailed how-to memo from Democratic lawyer Mark Herron, were
working furiously to trash military absentee ballots -
presumably because these votes were deemed more likely to be
for George W. Bush than for Al Gore.""

Why Hand Counting Is Unfair and Inaccurate


PALM BEACH COUNTY
 ~ Taping chads to ballots.  At least two witnesses noted
   ballots with tape over the chad of hole three, the
   Governor Bush hole.  Teresa LePore, the election
   supervisor, brushed off these mistakes.

 ~ Bush ballots in the Gore pile.  Both Friday night and
   Saturday morning, Bush ballots were found in the Gore pile
   to be counted as Gore votes.  A Democratic observer found
   these.  The Democrat observer later apologized to the
   Republican counterpart, telling him that the stack of
   ballots was different the prior night and had been
   sabotaged.

   Example:
    ~ Jim Williams, a Republican observer, witnessed Democrat
      observers picking up a handful of Gore ballots and
      finding several Bush ballots.  They tried to explain
      why Bush and Gore ballots were mixed together but
      couldn't.
    ~ Instead of pulling out the Bush ballots, Teresa LePore
      stacked all the ballots and put them into a box without
      any explanation to the counters or Palm Beach
      Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton.

 ~ Ballots as fans.  The Chairman of the Palm Beach
   Canvassing Board -- Judge Burton -- warned counters to not
   use ballots to fan themselves.

 ~ Elderly counters overworked and burned out.  Counters are
   working from 7AM to 10PM each day -- sometimes even later.
   Counters, many of whom are elderly, are exhausted, angry
   and burned out.  The room is poorly lit.  On Thursday
   night at 1AM, an elderly counter dropped 20 to 50 ballots
   over the floor, creating a huge scene.  Other observers
   stepped on the ballots.

 ~ In two precincts, the result has been so flawed that a
   second manual recount had to be conducted.

 ~ Counters are provided with no instruction and little
   guidance.  Because the Commission is canvassing at the
   same time that people count, counters often roam the room
   with their hands in the air, asking for guidance.

BROWARD COUNTY

 ~ Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors
   for the county the next.  Steven Michaelson of the public
   defender's office admitted in court Friday that Democrats
   are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors.

 ~ Different standards at different tables.  There are
   untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors
   at the next table how to conduct the count.  Affidavits
   from Florida residents serving as Republican observers
   state that there is confusion, multiple touching and
   passing of ballots between inspectors, moving precinct
   ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were
   already being counted, etc.

 ~ Conflicting statements.  A Broward County attorney said a
   manual count requires machine error, yet the board
   reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count
   despite no machine problems.  Canvassing Board Chairman
   Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no
   evidence of equipment problems, and that he was surprised
   by the very small number of changes discovered (+4 for
   Gore).

 ~ Falling chad on the floor, on the counting tables, on
   chairs, etc.  There is no reasonable assurance to voters
   that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure
   the integrity and security of the ballots.  The canvassing
   board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the
   counting until they do so.  Election officials,
   specifically Judge Lee, have simply expressed that the
   chad should be brushed on the floor.  After the first day
   of counting, 78 chad were collected from the ground and
   tables.

 ~ Considering altering the rules to include ""dimpled""
   ballots.  Despite being a quarter of the way through the
   manual recount (approx. 160 precincts), the Broward County
   board is now considering including ""dimpled"" ballots as
   votes.  This has been the centerpiece of the Gore strategy
   to gain additional votes.

DALEY, CHRISTOPHER TRY TO KEEP HILL DEMOCRATS FROM
ABANDONING GORE
11/19/00

""Late last week, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley and
former Secretary of State Warren Christopher quietly
informed the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate,
Dick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, that if Gore couldn't win on
the hand recounts, the campaign would fold its tent, sources
told TIME. They cautioned that 'the principals aren't there
yet' --Gore and Joe Lieberman weren't yet ready to go along -
'but they will be.' Daley and Christopher would find a way
to get the message to them, TIME reports in its current
issue....

""Gephardt feared that if Florida's secretary of state
Katherine Harris certified a Bush victory, House Democrats
would start abandoning Gore. 'People are saying, Enough is
enough,' a leading Democrat said Friday. 'It's time to be a
good loser.' To buy time, Gephardt organized a Friday-
afternoon conference call for Lieberman and House Democrats.
About 120 phoned in to hear Lieberman's pep talk.""

GORE CAMPAIGN ATTEMPTS PRESSURE TACTICS
11/18/00

""Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher called the
Democratic lawyer for Palm Beach County's elections
supervisor to try to get the attorney to use his influence
to assure a manual recount would be conducted there, the
lawyer says.

""Christopher, who is leading the Gore campaign's recount
effort in Florida, made the phone call Thursday morning to
Bruce Rogow, who represents elections supervisor Theresa
LePore.

""'It was an effort to have me persuade my client to vote in
favor of starting the manual recount on Thursday. I told him
no. I told him we'd have to wait,'"" Rogow said.

""Rogow said he didn't consider it appropriate for
Christopher or Dershowitz to try to 'persuade me to give
certain advice to my client.'""

UPI Commentary
SLEAZE, SLEAZE, SLEAZE
11/18/00

""Desperate to win the White House, Democrats have used
several strategies to set up a victory at the end of the
day....

""Elector is a position of public trust, so some level of
scrutiny is fair. What is not fair, and is, in fact
sinister, are revelations that Bob Beckel, Democrat solon,
occasional host of Crossfire, and campaign manager for
Walter Mondale's failed 1984 presidential bid, may be
engaged in some of the most vile skullduggery since
Watergate.

""It is an admittedly strong metaphor but frighteningly
appropriate. Since the morning after the election, there
have been rumors afoot that some in the Democrat party might
make serious attempts to switch votes in the Electoral
College.

""If Bush wins Florida, he becomes president by one more
electoral vote than the required 270. If three Republican
electors switch to Gore, the Tennessean gains a majority and
wins the White House.

""According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and
elsewhere, Beckel, who has close ties to Gore recount team
leader Warren Christopher, is engaged in an opposition
research project targeting Republican electors.

""Calling his efforts 'information gathering,' he says he is
working independently of the Gore campaign.

""Bill Daley, the vice president's campaign chairman, has
publicly shied away from any talk of lobbying electors. 'I
think there is a presumption that those members who are
voting, vote based upon the election,"" he has said. 'I
believe the vast majority of them are legally bound. And I
would assume if you're legally bound, you believe you're
morally bound.'

""Anyone in politics knows 'opposition research' is a polite
synonym for digging up dirt. The threat explicit in Beckel's
project is that the lives of electors are going to be
examined and given the same treatment Larry Flynt gave
former Republican Congressman Bob Livingston.

""Beckel told the Journal his procedure is to 'call on mostly
Democrats, but some Republicans too, and ask 'Who are these
electors, and what do you know about them?' That is what
blackmailers do too. Democrats need to call, today, for
Beckel to stop and use heavy hammers to insure that he does.
The presidential election must not be decided based on late
night phones calls to electors asking 'Hey buddy, who was
that woman you went with to Las Vegas last year?' Decency
and liberty demand it.""

Dear Eric,

Thank you for signing your petition to certify the election
at ElectionIntegrity2000.com.

Like many Americans, I'm sure you're trying to get the most
accurate, up-to-the-minute information about what's
happening down in Florida.  But can you really trust the
information you get from the liberal media?

In fact, the liberal media has been behind this election
controversy from the beginning.

That's why I'm passing on to you this letter I received
from my friend Jim Roberts at Radio America.

Radio America is doing something about this attempt by the
liberal media to hijack the election.  I urge you to take
just a minute to read Jim's letter and to listen to Radio
America over the internet for unbiased election coverage.

For Election Integrity,
Bruce Eberle

---------------------------------------------------------
To: Bruce Eberle
From: Jim Roberts
Subject: Unbiased media coverage of the election...
---------------------------------------------------------

Dear Bruce,

The liberal media is at it again.

They used every trick in the book to try to help Al Gore win
on election night.

And following a vote that didn't come out the way the
liberal media wanted it to... the media used their massive
influence to drum up controversy in Florida to try to
overturn the whole election.

On election night, the network media shamefully tried to
influence the election by declaring Al Gore the winner in
Florida before the polls were closed in that state -- and
hours before the polls were closed in the rest of the
country.

And the media all but declared Gore to be the overall winner
based on his ""win"" in Florida and other early states.

This clearly biased move led to thousands of discouraged
George W. Bush voters in Florida and other swing states to
leave long poll lines BEFORE they voted.

Who knows what the outcome might have been in Florida and
other swing states such as New Mexico, Oregon, and
California if the media had not falsely declared Gore to be
Florida's winner so early.

And then the media tried to overturn the most crucial swing
state -- Florida -- by inventing controversy and scandal
there.

The liberal media has always been biased...

.. but never before have they so blatantly tried to rig an
election in favor of their liberal candidate.

And who knows what tricks they may still have up their
sleeve to overturn the election and put Al Gore in the
White House.

Believe me, until the last Gore lawsuit is dismissed, the
liberal media will cling to the hope of getting their man
elected despite the actual outcome of the election.

That's why Radio America is so important.

Radio America is the one national media source that is
giving truthful, unbiased election information.

Radio America is a non-profit radio network that broadcasts
nationwide 24 hours a day.  We represent the views of
Americans like you.  That's why we're called ""The Voice of
Main Street America.""

During all the controversy and confusion surrounding this
election, you can count on Radio America to cut through the
liberal bias and broadcast the truth.

And now you can listen to Radio America on-line over your
computer.

That's right, you can hear our unbiased, no-nonsense news
and reporting over the internet 24 hours a day.

To find out how you can listen to Radio America, just click
on the link below.

Please don't let the liberal news media go unopposed.

For America,
Jim Roberts, President of Radio America

P.S. This is vitally important for the future of America.
Please forward this e-mail to anyone you know who cares
about saving this election from being stolen by the liberal
media!

Let's jump right into our Upgraded and  Downgraded Players.? As we head down 
the home stretch, identifying  those players moving up or down can be the 
difference between making the  playoffs or watching from the sidelines.?  As 
we head into our 13th week of listing these players, it,s  inevitable that 
some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade  list.? Make sure 
you understand,  what we,re talking about is players that are moving.? In 
other words, a player like TE Chad  Lewis could appear on the downgrade list 
and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.? It just  means I,m 
concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Likewise, a player like WR 
Willie  Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he,s still fairly far 
down the  list of WRs.? It,s all about which  direction players are moving.?  
Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the  difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or 
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this 
week.

?

QBs Moving Up

QB Gus Frerotte (Den)? You have  to love Frerotte stepping in and performing 
like he did.? Of course, when  you throw the ball 58 times, good things often 
happen.? When you throw the  ball 58 times with a 62% completion percentage, 
great things happen.? Look  for more of the same.

QB Kerry Collins (NYG)? The  Giants may be struggling but Collins continues 
to put up excellent Fantasy  Football numbers.? With guys like Kurt Warner 
and Daunte Culpepper, it's  easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs 
come from great teams.? Not  always the case as Collins is showing.? Often 
times, it's teams with  vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco 
that provides the QB  motivation to play catch-up.? Collins looks comfortable 
in the pocket and  if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike 
Hilliard healthy for four  quarters, who knows what might happen.

QB Brett Favre (GB)? He's  baaaaack.? I said last week that Favre coming back 
on the bad foot would be  storybook material for a storybook kind of guy and 
Favre delivered.? 2 TDs  and 301 yards have the Packers riding high and 
believing they can?make some  noise.? WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an 
excellent #2 WR and RB Ahman Green  is filling the void left by Dorsey 
Levens.? 

QB Aaron Brooks (NO)? I may be  in the minority (imagine that...) but I was 
very impressed with Brooks taking  over for Jeff Blake.? He was not a #2 QB 
like Jim Miller in Chicago that  knew he'd be inserted any minute.? Brooks 
was thrust into the game and  responded very nicely.? He's skinny at #205 but 
tall (6' 4"")? Big  league arm and nice mobility.? Of particular note was his 
tendency to throw  to WR Willie Jackson.? We'll see if that continues.? Sure, 
he's a long  shot but if you're desperate for a QB, he could be a nice  
surprise.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD)? Hold the  presses, Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade 
list.? Seriously, he's an  easy target and I'll admit to taking my share of 
shots but you can't deny the  guy has skills.? Yes, there were some fluky 
plays with Crockett injuring  himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw.? 
(although the 3 TDs on 13  completions did make for a wild looking box score 
for Leaf)? He's got some  weapons in Jeff Graham, Curtis Conway and his best 
receiver, TE Freddie  Jones.? He's as flaky as they come but he might be 
worth a look if you're  dying at QB.

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Fred Taylor (Jac)? Taylor  put together one of the best performances of 
the year Sunday night.? The  fact that he did it against the very tough rush 
defense of the Steelers makes it  even all the more impressive.? This isn't 
like rolling up 200 yards on the  Cowboys or Cardinals.? Clearly, there's 
reason for huge hope as if he can  do this against Pittsburgh, he can do it 
against anyone.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? Once  again, Lewis ran hard.? He's got to be considered 
one of the better RBs in  the game right now.? I still worry about how 
durable he'll be but he's  looked great lately averaging 6.7 yards per carry 
Sunday for 187 yards.? If  it weren't for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturing 
a TD here and there, he'd be  even higher.

RB Darnell Autry (Phi)? Autry  refuses to hand over the #1 RB job to Stanley 
Pritchett or anyone else.?  He's not very flashy but he gets the job done 
both rushing and receiving.?  The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in 
the standings and Autry figures to  be a large part of that success.

RB Ahman Green (GB)? I'd be a  little worried right now if I were Dorsey 
Levens.? Green averaged 6.4 yards  per carry Sunday as he rolled up 180 total 
yards.? Most importantly, was  his number of fumbles: Zero.? No one's ever 
doubted his incredible physical  skills, but now he seems to be bringing the 
mental game to go with  it.

RB Mike Anderson (Den)? I hate  to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a great 
impression of Isaac Bruce's  maddening 1998 on again, off again season.? As 
you know, Davis missed  another game and once again, Anderson stepped in 
nicely.?? By now, you  know it's tough to predict what Davis is going to do 
each week so it looks to me  as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup.

RB Jamal Anderson (Atl)?  Anderson's 4.5 yards per carry reminded many of his 
1998 season.? He's  running with power and speed and finally appears to be 
over the knee  injury.? I think he's been over it physically for a while now 
but it seems  he's handling the mental aspect too.

?

WRs Moving Up

WR Willie Jackson (NO)? New QB  Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being 
thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson  responded well with 4 catches and 
85 yards including 2 TDs.? Often times,  you'll see a backup QB favor the 
backup WRs as they're familiar with them.?  We'll see if this continues.? I'm 
guessing Brooks will get comfortable  throwing to Joe Horn this week but 
Jackson is still definitely worth a  shot.

WR Joe Jurevicius (NYG)? As I  mentioned above, QB Kerry Collins is playing 
very well. With Ike Hilliard set to  miss some time, Jurevicius should get a 
chance to show what he can do.?  He's long been a Fantasy Football tease 
showing flashes but never really having  the opportunity for playing time.? 
Let's see what he can  do.

WR Terry Glenn (NE)? I've  been?high on Glenn since June.? He made me look 
good early on but had  cooled midseason.? He's now back warming up again and 
for you Glenn owners,  your patience is paying off.? QB Drew Bledsoe didn't 
have a TD, but he did  roll up the yards.? Once again, Glenn was the prime  
target.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)? Smith  looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as 
the Jags awakened their  offense?Sunday night.? Smith seems back in synch 
with QB Mark Brunell  and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game.? 
There may not be  enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enough 
for  Smith.

WR James McNight (Dal)? Yes,  he's a long shot considering the horrid play of 
Troy Aikman Sunday but you have  to like a WR who's getting a ton of looks.? 
And McNight's getting those  looks from Aikman.? Can't make plays without the 
ball...

?

TEs Moving Up

TE Jay Reimersma (Buf)? We've  been waiting for Reimersma to return to form 
and he looks to be on his  way.? He was heavily involved and seemed 
comfortable with ""new"" QB Rob  Johnson.? He can be a vital part of the 
offense and you have to think  Johnson will continue to utilize him.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)? Mangum's  no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a 
nice target.? 4 catches for 47  yards is an improvement from what they've had 
at TE and it looks like he's back  and healthy now.

?

Players Moving  Down

?

QBs Moving Down

QB Steve Beuerlein (Car)?  There's only so much a QB can do by himself.? He 
lost Wesley Walls a couple  of weeks ago. I thought Beuerlein could handle 
losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but  losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injury 
proved too much.? His OL is less  than stellar and he's just not having much 
time to throw.?  

QB Shaun King (TB)? King swings  back toward the side of mediocrity after a 
91 yard passing effort against  Chicago.? It looked that bad too.? Even for a 
Les Steckel  Offense.? Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a 
positive as  teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson.

QB Steve McNair (Ten)? Not all  the turnovers Sunday were McNair's fault but 
he certainly had a hand in  them.? His problem remains a lack of healthy WRs 

"
"and a stellar RB in Eddie  George who can carry the load.? Last year, it was 
McNair vulturing TDs from  George but it doesn't seem to be a problem this 
year.? 

QB Jake Plummer (Ari)? If  you're a regular reader, you know I'm not a 
Plummer fan.? I'm especially  not a fan now that he's hurt as well.? He may 
get back soon but it won't  matter for this team that's in shambles 
offensively.

?

RBs Moving Down

RB Thomas Jones (Ari)? Jones'  was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but 
still, you like to see a better yards  per carry average than negative 2...

RB Kevin Faulk (NE)? Either  Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is 
not a very good football  player.? How else do you explain Faulk earning one 
carry while his RB  partner J.R. Redmond was inactive?? Patrick Pass got the 
bulk of the work  but was ineffective.? I'm guessing, it's the fumbling that 
earned his spot  in the doghouse.? 

RB Ron Dayne (NYG)? As we've  said so often in the past, Ron Dayne's 
productivity is tied directly to how well  the Giants are playing.? If New 
York is leading, you'll see Dayne.? If  they're trailing, it's the Tiki 
Barber show.? Lately, it's been more Tiki  than Dayne.? And if the Giants 
don't make some improvements on defense, I  don't see that changing.

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)?  Prentice got folks excited early in the year but 
he's been disappointing of  late.? Prentice is losing carries to Jamel White 
and that doesn't look to  change anytime soon.? 

?

WRs Moving Down

WR Marcus Robinson (Chi)?  Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it 
appears the QB rotation is  affecting his play.? With Shane Matthews 
starting, Robinson had 5  receptions for 53 yards.? While those numbers are 
certainly not horrible,  they're not quite what we expect from Marcus.? He 
could improve with  another week of practice but I'm a little concerned right 
now.

WR Joe Horn (NO)? As I  mentioned above, I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but 
there is no way that he's  anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff 
Blake.? Of special worry was  the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable 
throwing the ball to Willie  Jackson.

WR Donald Hayes?(Car)?  Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his status 
for next week is  uncertain.? He's a vital part of the offense and will be 
missed if he can't  go.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ)? As the  Jets have struggled, so has Chrebet.? He 
turned in another small game  Sunday with 22 yards on 2 catches.? These 
numbers just won't get it done  for a #1 WR.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)? 2 weeks  ago, it was Amani Toomer taking the hard 
shot.? Last week it was Hilliard  with the highlight hit.? He looks like he 
may miss a game or two which is  bad news for Hilliard owners but good news 
of Joe Jurevicius  owners.

?

TEs Moving Down

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl)? Kelly's  just too up and down to rely on to any 
degree.? When he's featured in the  gameplan, he's?a nice player and can be 
effective.? It's just that  it's so hard to guess what game that will be...

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ)? Another  Jet receiver that's struggling.? Becht is 
frustrating as he'll show some  nice flashes and then disappear for long 
stretches.? I'm afraid to say he's  starting to look like...a Jet's TE.

Dear Eric,

Another 25,417 Petitions were shipped to Florida today by
ElectionIntegrity2000.com.

Thanks to you we expect to have 100,000 signed petitions to
finalize the certification of the George W. Bush victory by
the end of the day today.  That's great news!

ElectionIntegrity2000.com has already been mentioned on
CSPAN and in the San Francisco Chronicle, but what we really
want is to turn the heads of the major networks -- and
that's going to take numbers.

Right now the mainstream media is claiming that the will of
the people favors Al Gore.  We can turn the tide --
especially if we have several hundred thousand Americans
behind us.

So don't give up!  Keep forwarding our messages, or tell
your friends directly to visit
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com

""Hand counting"" of ballots is still going on in
several counties in Florida.  Make no mistake, this fight
is far from over.  That's why we are going to keep
collecting petitions until George W. Bush is officially
certified as President-elect and until Al Gore concedes.

Remember, with every day that passes without a certified
Bush victory, Al Gore's chances of stealing this election
increase.

For Election Integrity,

Jamie Hogan

Take a 20 oz. soda bottle (plastic one) and fill it 3/4 the way  with water. 
Freeze it and use to keep perishable food cold. Put  in a zip lock bag to 
keep from dripping. When the bottle unthaws,  use as drinking water. Throw 
away (or recycle) soda bottle when  empty. -Joyce W.

Latest News on Denver QB Brian Griese:

http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/broncos/wed.htm  Denver Broncos
quarterback Brian Griese, the AFC's top-rated passer, might be lost for the
regular season with a severely separated throwing shoulder.

''He'll be out a minimum of three weeks,'' Denver coach Mike Shanahan said
Tuesday.

The news stunned the Broncos, who watched Monday night as Griese shook off
the injury and led his team back into the AFC West race by knocking off
first-place Oakland 27-24.

Griese, already playing with cartilage damage in his right shoulder,
suffered a third-degree separation while being chased out of bounds in the
first quarter. Griese, whose first shoulder injury this season also was vs.
the Raiders, returned after taking a pain-killing injection.

''When they told me that I might be out three, four, five weeks, I said, 'If
that's the case, put me back in there so I can play one more time,' '' he
said.



In the ""Here we go again"" department, RB Terrell Davis was noticeably
limping after Monday Night's game.  From the same USA Today article : ""Also
in question are the status of Terrell Davis, who was limping noticeably
after the game, and guard Mark Schlereth, who could be headed for yet
another knee surgery in what likely is his final season. Davis, in fact,
revealed that his left foot had been bothering him the past 2-3 weeks. ""

I had also heard reports he was bothered by a calf problem.  Not sure
whether it's the foot or the calf (or both) and it's not clear yet whether
the injury is serious enough to be a factor this weekend.  I'll keep you
posted and just wanted to give you the headsup.

Joe

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 11/28/00 
 Connell's status for Sunday's game against the Giants is seriously in 
doubt.  He sprained his knee in last week's game against the Eagles, and Head 
Coach Norv Turner has already stated that Connell will not start.  This 
should serve notice to Fantasy owners who have Connell on their roster not to 
put him in their lineup this week.      

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Head Coach Norv Turner has stated that Fryar will get the start this week 
against the Giants.  He had four catches for 50 yards in last week's loss to 
the Eagles, and could see extended playing time if Albert Connell is unable 
to play for the 'Skins.  Fryar isn't the type of receiver you want to depend 
on for production, especially with the Fantasy league playoffs looming.  
Consider another option if your roster allows it.      

 James Thrash , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 The Washington wideout caught five passes for 121 yards and a touchdown in 
last Sunday's loss to the Eagles.  He seemed to thrive with Jeff George under 
center, but now that Brad Johnson is back from injury, it may be a return to 
mediocrity.  Thrash could, however, see some looks this week if Albert 
Connell's knee injury keeps him from playing extended minutes.       

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Harris sprained his left knee in last week's loss to the Vikings.  However, 
the injury shouldn't keep Harris from playing this week as Dallas travels to 
Tampa Bay to face the Buccaneers.  After a fast start, Harris has really been 
quieted by opposing defenses in recent weeks.  He is a good backup tight end 
in most Fantasy leagues, but his inconsistent numbers keep him from being an 
every week starter.      

 Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 The Doomsday Defense has now become The M.A.S.H. unit.  The Cowboys lost yet 
another player on Monday when defensive end Peppi Zellner tore his ACL in 
practice, effectively ending his season. Zellner now joins Leon Lett (knee), 
George Teague (foot), Chad Hennings (neck) and Darren Woodson (arm) on the 
long list of defensive players who have been injured this season.  Only 
Woodson is still available to the team, but his status for this week's game 
at Tampa Bay is still uncertain. With all of the injuries on defense coupled 
with a brutal final four weeks of the season, it would be a good idea to drop 
Dallas' unit before the playoffs.    

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/28/00 
 Smith, who suffered a concussion on Thanksgiving Day against the Vikings, is 
expected to start this Sunday at Tampa Bay.  He was held out of practice on 
Monday for precautionary reasons but will return to the field for Dallas' 
first full practice of the week on Wednesday. Dallas is likely to give Smith 
the ball quite a bit on Sunday, as they attempt to establish the run against 
a tough Bucs' defense.     

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/28/00 
 Head Coach Norv Turner has indicated that Davis should be ready to play in 
this week's pivotal NFC East matchup against the Giants.  Davis missed last 
week's game against the Eagles with a hairline fracture of his right forearm. 
The return of Davis is great news for Fantasy players who own his rights, 
especially with the playoffs just around the corner.      

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 11/28/00 
 It's official - Rams Coach Mike Martz has announced that Warner will be his 
starting quarterback against Carolina on Sunday. This is good news for 
Fantasy owners of Rams players, as the team is a lot stronger offensively 
when Warner is taking the snaps.  

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 
 Price caught six passes for 44 yards in Sunday's loss to the Buccaneers.  He 
has been a major disappointment this season to Fantasy owners who took a 
chance on him.  In fact, Price hasn't caught a touchdown pass since Week One 
against the Titans. Unless you are involved in a deep league, look elsewhere 
for a reserve wideout.     

 Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Riemersma caught five passes for 82 yards in Sunday's 31-17 loss to the 
Buccaneers. Although he may not post solid numbers every week, his production 
is consistent enough to warrant a starting spot in many Fantasy leagues.  
Keep Riemersma on you roster as the playoffs approach.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 The Bengals have upgraded Mitchell's condition from questionable to probable 
for next Sunday's game against Arizona. Coach Dick LeBeau has not yet named 
his starter for that game, although Mitchell would give the Cincinnati 
offense its best shot at solid Fantasy numbers.  

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Smith completed 10 of 20 passes for 129 yards and a touchdown Sunday against 
Pittsburgh, and the Bengals applauded his efforts in the game. His teammates 
said he was as sharp and confident on the field as he's been all season. 
Coach Dick LeBeau hasn't yet named his starter for next Sunday, although we 
wouldn't recommend either Cincinnati quarterback at this stage of the Fantasy 
season.  

 Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 
 Moulds had a huge day against the Bucs, catching eight passes while 
accounting for 122 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Look for Moulds to 
post good numbers this week against the Dolphins, a team who he has 
absolutely killed in the past.      

 Kevin Johnson , WR CLE - Top Dogs Updated 11/27/00 
 Johnson led the Browns with four catches for 85 yards Sunday against 
Baltimore, although most of that was due to a 67-yard reception that set up a 
Browns touchdown on the game's first drive. He's the closest thing to a 
viable Fantasy starter on the Browns, although the lack of a reliable passing 
game will limit his value over the season's final weeks.  

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Coach Chris Palmer has become increasingly frustrated with Northcutt in 
recent weeks, according to the Akron Beacon Journal . Northcutt has been 
dropping too many passes and committing costly fumbles, including one on a 
punt return Sunday against Baltimore. He had no catches on the day. Palmer is 
likely to start Northcutt the rest of the season, but he's not a recommended 
Fantasy receiver.  

 Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Alexander had a productive day for Washington, catching four passes for 39 
yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to the Eagles.  The 'Skins tight end 
hasn't been consistent at all this season, however, so use another option at 
the position if at all possible.    

 Doug Pederson , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Pederson completed just eight of 16 passes for 108 yards and an interception 
Sunday against Baltimore before being lifted in the second quarter for backup 
Spergon Wynn. We don't recommend Pederson over the season's final weeks, as 
the Browns' offense is showing how much injuries have depleted it this year.  

 Spergon Wynn , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Wynn, who replaced Doug Pederson at the start of the second half of Sunday's 
game against Baltimore, wasn't overly successful in the 18 plays he was a 
part of. He completed five of nine passes, but they went for just 30 yards, 
and he was sacked four times, losing a fumble once. Coach Chris Palmer 
continues to say he wants to bring Wynn along slowly, and the Browns' offense 
is reeling, so don't expect much from him over the season's final weeks.  

 Chris Redman , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Redman was called upon during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against 
Cleveland, although he did not attempt a pass. Unless Baltimore runs away 
with any of its next three games, he will likely not see any more action this 
season.  

 Matt Stover , K BAL - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 
 Stover kicked three field goals Sunday against Cleveland, breaking his 
single-season mark of 29 and passing the 1,000-point mark for his career. He 
added five extra points and now has an NFL-best 116 points on the season. 
Unless you hear otherwise, Stover should be a permanent fixture in your 
starting lineup for the remainder of the season.  

 David Akers , K PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Akers kicked two field goals against the Redskins, including what turned out 
to be the game winner.  He connected on boots of 33 and 30 yards, and has now 
kicked nine field goals in his last three games. Look for Akers' success to 
continue this week against the Titans, in game where the placekickers could 
play a major role in the final score.    

 Jeff Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Talk about a good touchdown percentage - Thomason has caught only nine 
passes all year, but five have been for a touchdown.  Although he does seem 
to get into the end zone quite a bit, don't let the numbers fool you.  Unless 
you are in a deeper Fantasy league, Thomason won't be a reliable option when 
it comes time for your playoffs to begin.  

 Sam Gash , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Gash, making his sixth start in place of injured Obafemi Ayanbadejo, had a 
two-yard touchdown pass in yesterday's game against Cleveland. Don't take 
that to mean he's a sleeper over the remainder of the season; Gash had just 
one other catch (for six yards) in the game and will continue to serve almost 
entirely as a blocker, a role he is perfectly-suited for.  

 Shaun King , QB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/27/00 
 King was rather mediocre against the Bills Sunday.  He completed 10-of-18 
passes for 106 yards.  King has now gone two consecutive games without 
throwing a touchdown pass.  That should change this week when he faces a 
Dallas defense with an almost nonexistent pass rush.  The Cowboys have a 
league worst 17 sacks this season.  King's offensive line will provide him 
with plenty of time to pick the Cowboys' secondary apart.    

 Ravens , DT BAL - Eric Bass Updated 11/27/00 
 Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming 
the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted 
yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its 
record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just 
seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, 
an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to 
say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore 
has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense 
during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and 
Arizona coming off the bye.  

 Charles Johnson , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Johnson has been very unproductive over Philadelphia's last five games, 
compiling only only eleven catches and 94 yards receiving.  None of 
Philadelphia's receivers, including Johnson, is worth wasting a roster spot 
on at this point.  Look for better reserve wideouts before your playoffs 
begin.    

 Torrance Small , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Small could only haul in one pass for 18 yards against the Redskins.  He has 
been a real disappointment to Fantasy owners who took a chance on him, 
catching only one pass in four of his last five games.  It's time to look for 
an alternative to Small if he is still on your roster.    

 Tony Banks , QB BAL - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 
 Banks was called on during the third quarter of Sunday's game against 
Cleveland after it was well out of hand. He completed just two of three 
passes for 45 yards, but looked respectable in a reserve role. Although 
that's good news for the Ravens, don't read into this as a sign he'll get 
much, if any, playing time during Baltimore's final three games.  

 Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Top Dogs Updated 11/27/00 
 Johnson is struggling once again.  He had just two catches for 15 yards 
against the Bills Sunday.  After catching four TDs in three games, Johnson 
has just four catches in the last two.    

 Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Lewis was solid in Sunday's win over Washington, catching six passes for 53 
yards in the game.  He has had three consecutive productive games after a bit 
of a mid-season slump, and should get a number of looks this week against 
Tennessee. Keep him in the starting lineup as your Fantasy playoffs 
approach.

Darron,

This is the deal I phoned you about yesterday which Eric Moon put together  
-  should it be booked as Transportation deal instead of a Forward ?

No I don't.  This deal is a Physical Forward.  Usually when it pertains to a 
transportation the trader usually creates a Transportation Capacity ticket in 
Sitara.  When it hits our portfolio we would then set it up in Global 
Contracts.  

Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sylvia,

I'm looking into this deal and after researching it  it seems like there 
should be a separate Transportation Contract for this deal, and should not be 
confirmed by us on the Confirmation desk. Do you know anything about this 
deal or Contract ?

Eric Moon in Gas Structuring is the dealmaker and he asked me to talk to 
Darron Giron who is a book admin.
This deal relates to Tagg # EC3952  -  apparently they pulled loads of 
different transportation deals from our books and sold it on to Calpine. It 
seems to me there must be a Contract out there for this 8 year deal.

Hey folks. Just a note, Calpine Energy Services, LP deal #559974 was 
originally attached to a GTC due to the fact that the contracts group had not 
yet received the master contract. The contract was received & entered into 
Global this week & as a result we moved the above referenced deal to the 
master (Global #96056886). Transaction term information: 5/1/01 - 10/31/08.

Please reconfirm as necessary.

Thanks all!

I am setting these up so that they can be listed under US GAS WEST but I have 
a question. Does WEST-KEYSTONE-IDX have any positions? Does it need to be set 
as active?

Make sure your group is looking out for this.  

1. If copying post ids to run mini books they need to take the TDS flag off
2.  Since not everyone will do #1 - they should watch their position loads to 
make sure they are bringing in the correct post ids (they are listed in the 
load statement)   After they have closed this screen there isn't a way of 
seeing this.


Note I have changed working hours & currently come during lunch.  If you have 
questions concerning TDS systems call Bill Fortney x39952, or you can talk to 
Russ Severson.

Thanks,

The PortCalc screen has been changed in production to copy the TDS position 
load flag as is,
instead of setting it to 0.

It seems after some discussion the prevailing wisdom is to change the way the 
TDS flag works when copying a Post ID.

Risk would like to have the TDS flag copy to new Post IDs.  

Please make the change when possible.  I would put the Meta Calc having the 
flag a higher priority.

Thanks,

Bill

The TDS position load flag has been added to the PortCalc screen in
production. Please close your PortCalcs screens and bring up new ones 
to access this feature.

(The field is labelled TDS, and is located in the middle, left side of the 
screen.)

Jeremy Wong will be moving the TDS position load flag onto the Port Calc 
screen Thursday morning.  

Kenny Ha will then move the new release of TDS to use this flag into 
production Thursday night.  

Risk will have to flag their books with the new flag Thursday night so the 
trader positions will load correctly into TDS for Friday.  I will talk to 
everyone about the change on Thursday & send out a notice of other changes.

Subject: TDS Physical Positions

In order for the physical desks to roll out positions into TDS,  a mapping is 
required between the Org region code used in Portcalc
for the physical calc and the related Tagg book code that is used for that 
region.

An example would be similar to:

Org Region Code                             Tagg Book Code
CENTRAGULF                                  
FT-INTRA-GULF                        This is just an example and might not be 
a valid grouping


 TDS knows the Tagg books to pick up, it just does not know which physical 
region codes that are related to it.

Can you provide for your desk all Org Region Codes used on your desk, and 
what Tagg Book it would relate to.
If you could send me the list, I will forward them to the TDS developers.

Any questions or concerns, please call me.

Thanks
Russ

**************************** November 20, 2000  ************************

As sure as each hour brings a new court decision ( as sure cranberry sales
peak in November ( Thanksgiving surprise fares appear. We,re sending out
this special edition e-mail to give you a jump on these new deals. Plus,
in (festive) light of our new, lower Turkey Day fares and the short
workweek, we decided to release our Hot Deals By E-mail today and on
Wednesday of the upcoming holiday week. This will help those who want to
travel home for the holidays and visit the relatives (or get away from
Uncle Ed,s snoring during the football game). You can take advantage of a
two-day getaway that takes you where you want to go on Thanksgiving
Thursday and brings you back home Friday for a restful weekend. Airfares
are as low as $64 roundtrip, and just $151 roundtrip for travel up to
1,500 miles from your departing airport. Our Wednesday e-mail will also
offer newly negotiated deals to 15 Caribbean cities, including Cancun,
Grand Cayman, Montego Bay and St. Maarten with discounts reaching 60
percent for travel through June 15, 2001. If you,re going to be traveling
and unable to check your e-mail, why not ask a family member at your
destination to sign up for a free Hot Deals subscription, so you can check
the latest-breaking deals from their computers? Just tell them Tom Parsons
will be talking turkey on low-fare travel.

THANKSGIVING FARES $64 TO $189 RT THROUGHOUT 48 STATES.
With airfares as low as $64 roundtrip, Thanksgiving travel is within the
reach of almost everyone. If you,re having the traditional family dinner
at home, here,s your opportunity to bring in a few more family members or
friends to make the day more memorable. Or, surprise your family with a
short (and sweet) visit. In some cases, you can deliver yourself for
little more than what an FTD holiday bouquet would cost. A quick trip can
also provide a chance for some great Friday shopping. Head to New York
City for Macy,s Thanksgiving Day Parade and check out the festive store
windows. Visit the gigantic Mall of America in Minneapolis, Rodeo Drive in
Beverly Hills or the Dallas Galleria. To qualify for these super low
fares, you must depart on Thanksgiving Day and be on a return flight no
later than midnight Friday, November 25. One other important plus with
this special is that we can waive the standard $40 roundtrip fuel
surcharge. How cheap are these two-day stay fares? How about Dallas/Fort
Worth to San Diego or Los Angeles for $135 roundtrip? You can fly from
Chicago to New York City, Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or Atlanta for
$103 roundtrip. Fly from San Francisco to Minneapolis, Oklahoma City or
San Antonio for $151 roundtrip. Denver to Dallas/Fort Worth, Kansas City
or Des Moines is $103 roundtrip. Washington (DC) to Cleveland, Detroit,
Pittsburgh or Charlotte is $99 roundtrip. Atlanta to Indianapolis,
Louisville, Dayton or Columbus (OH) is $79 roundtrip. Check out our
last-minute Turkey Day fares at
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=10098966

COMING WEDNESDAY: 15 CARIBBEAN CITIES ON SALE FROM $328 RT.
We are very close to posting new roundtrip fares for travel through June
15, 2001 to 15 cities in the Caribbean. As winter arrives and temperatures
drop, so will our airfares. If you think peak season travel to sunny
destinations is prohibitive, take a peek at these bargains. Depart from
your choice of over 40 U.S. cities to Caribbean destinations such as San
Juan, St. Maarten, St. Thomas, St. Croix, Nassau, Montego Bay, Grand
Cayman and many others starting at just $328 roundtrip. For example, from
Atlanta to St. Thomas, the peak winter rate is  $718 roundtrip. Our fare
is only $328. Boston to Cancun is priced at $818 roundtrip, but we can get
you there for $328, saving you almost $500 per ticket.  Los Angeles, San
Francisco, San Diego or Seattle to St. Maarten or St. Thomas sells for
$986. Our new low fare is $468. Get read for our Wednesday e-mail and its
full-blown thaw-out sale, then prepare to bask in the warmth of a
beautiful Caribbean island with 85-degree temperatures. When these fares
are released, please act fast. We don,t want you to be left out in the
cold. Airfares this low, with a limited inventory, will sell out in a
hurry. Pump up your tropical travel with a few more details at
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=10107781

TWO MORE DAYS: DOWN UNDER UP FOR GRABS AT UP TO $700 OFF.
Forget about costly airfares to Australia and New Zealand of $1,600
roundtrip or more and be Bestfares.com bound for Down Under for as little
as $838. We have a wide selection of 53 U.S. departure cities to get you
on your way Melbourne or Sydney, Australia or Auckland, New Zealand from
the West Coast for $838 roundtrip. Pay just $666 roundtrip for children
age two through 11. Airfares to Brisbane start at  $938 roundtrip, $741
for children. Depart through December 11 or from December 24 through
January 7 for the rock-bottom prices. You can even fly on these fares for
the upcoming holidays*and it will soon be summer in the South Pacific.
Just keep in mind that tickets must be purchased in the next two days and
get ready to use your U.S. dollars for maximum value when you arrive in
Australia.

FLY BETWEEN THE MIDWEST AND EAST COAST FOR $198 TO $218 RT.
Roundtrip travel between select U.S. markets is as low as $198 for travel
through August 15, 2001. Our sale fares from Central U.S. cities include
Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and many
more to over 50 Eastern cities. They range from $198 to $218 roundtrip,
saving you 60 percent or more. Fly from the Midwest or the south-central
part of the country to cities in the East at huge savings, too. For
example, the standard roundtrip fare between Minneapolis and Portland (ME)
is $548*far more than double our $218 fare. Prices are valid for travel
Monday through Thursday, and for $10 more each way, you can fly on
weekends. For more domestic discount fares, click to

$298 RT OR LESS THREE-DAY ADVANCE FARES.
Our great American getaways take you where you want to go with only a
three-day advance and a ticket price of $298 roundtrip or less. Travel
through August 15, 2001. If you want to travel in a hurry or have a
last-minute pre-holiday business trip, don,t put aside your desire or risk
losing the deal. We make last-minute travel a snap, with savings of up to
80 percent. Keep these deals in mind when last-minute holiday needs come
up, or you want to see a new mall in a different city. Better yet, put
give your self a break mid-way in the season, and come back refreshed and
ready to go. For details, access:

A&M / UT Grads (or anyone wanting to become an honorary grad),

 Sorry for the late notice, but we (we meaning UT and A&M grads here at 
Enron) are trying to raise money for scholarships 
for the two greatest schools in Texas (well, one is slightly better than the 
other).  We are having a Flag Football challenge tomorrow
(sorry, all the teams are full).  If you would like to come to show some 
support, it should be a blast!  I have to have the money 
collected by 5:00 PM today.  Any contributions will be matched by Enron.  If 
you would like to contribute to A&M, make checks 
payable to Texas A&M Foundation.  For UT, make them payable to University of 
Texas at Austin (why do they always have to 
call it UT at Austin, like anyone would assume you meant UT Arlington when 
you say UT?).  Anyway, ANY contributions will be 
GREATLY appreciated.  Call me at x54915 and I'll be glad to come get them, or 
stop by my location at EB652b.

Thanks!
Jonathan Anderson
Class of '99 (A&M)

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Skinner was activated from the injured list by the Clippers today. He missed 
five games dating back to November 18 with a sprained right ankle. Skinner 
will need to rebound from a slow start to this season, as he is averaging 5.8 
points and 4.7 rebounds in 10 games thus far.  

 Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Clippers waived Ekezie today, just one day after the team acquired him 
from the Washington Wizards. He likely won't have any Fantasy value anywhere 
he ends up this season, as he's averaging just 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in 
10 games thus far.  

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Barros was activated from the injured list for tonight's game against New 
Jersey. Unfortunately, the 11-year veteran probably won't have much Fantasy 
value this season, as he'll have a harder time getting playing time in 
Detroit than he did in Boston.  

 Don MacLean , F MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The NBA suspended MacLean for five games without pay today for violating the 
steroid policy of the league and the NBA Players' Association. He has been 
limited to just three games this season and was scheduled to miss at least a 
month after undergoing surgery on his right foot November 15. It's unlikely 
MacLean will garner any further Fantasy value this season after this recent 
development, especially considering he is the first player in league history 
to be suspended for steroid use.  

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Dickerson is expected to come off the injured list for Friday's game against 
Indiana or Sunday's matchup with San Antonio.  He has been sidelined for over 
a week with a sprained ankle.  Dickerson will be a little out of synch at 
first but look for him to pick up where he left off after a few games.    

 Samaki Walker , F SA - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Walker is suffering from a sprained left ankle and is not expected to play 
in Wednesday's game against the Kings.  He was on crutches Sunday and Monday, 
but rode a stationary bike during Tuesday's practice.  The ankle could affect 
Walker's numbers for awhile when he finally does return.  Although he has 
been somewhat productive, Walker comes off the bench and is only valuable in 
deeper Fantasy leagues.      

 Tariq Abdul-Wahad , G DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Although Raef LaFrentz will return to the starting lineup, Wahad will 
continue to come off the bench.  Wahad was removed from the starting lineup 
along with LaFrentz two games ago.  As has been the case for most of his 
career Abdul-Wahad has struggled with his shooting this season and hasn't 
been a productive Fantasy player, averaging 5.5 ppg this season.  

 Raef LaFrentz , C DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 LaFrentz will be back in the starting lineup after coming off the bench the 
last two games, his replacement Keon Clark will go back to the bench.  
Although LaFrentz hasn't played too well this season head coach Dan Issel has 
stated he made the original move to prevent singling out one player for the 
team's struggles.  Meaning he benched LaFrentz to appease Tariq Abdul-Wahad 
who was also removed as a starter.  LaFrentz may not play much better now 
that he is back in the starting team but he will still provide as much 
Fantasy production as most other centers.     

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Buckner has missed the team's last five games with a sprained right foot.  
He had an injection in his sprained right foot that will prevent him from 
participating in practices for at least 2-3 days.  This will keep him out of 
action for at least the next two games.  Hubert Davis will continue to start 
at shooting guard and Michael Finley will play small forward in his absence.  
When Buckner finally does return it will take awhile for him to get back into 
game form.     

 Etan Thomas , C DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Thomas has a cast on his right foot for a fractured bone under his right big 
toe.  He is expected to wear the cast for three weeks.  His condition will be 
re-evaluated at that time.  Monitor his situation for now.  He is a good 
rebounder and shot-blocker who may be able to help a Fantasy team in 
January.   

 Mark Bryant , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Bryant signed with the Mavericks Tuesday for the pro-rated veteran minimum.  
He was released by Cleveland on November 15.  Forward Bill Curley was waived 
to make room for Bryant.  Bryant will get some playing time off the bench but 
won't be much help to a Fantasy team.    

 Keith Van Horn , F NJ - The Wave Updated 11/29/00 
 Van Horn has been cleared to do some ""light running"" by team doctors and 
expects to return to the Nets in about two weeks.  He broke his left leg 
during a preseason game against the Orlando Magic.  When Van Horn does 
return, Fantasy owners will certainly be scrambling to pick him up.  

 Jim McIlvaine , C NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 McIlvaine did not play in Tuesday's game against the Jazz due to an 
intestinal infection and won't accompany the team for Wednesday's game in 
Detroit.  His return is yet to be determined.  McIlvaine holds no Fantasy 
value.  

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Atkins is still suffering from a sprained ankle, which kept him out of 
practice on Tuesday.  Although he is listed as probable for Wednesday's game 
against the Nets, rookie Mateen Cleaves may start in Atkins' place.  Even if 
he doesn't play, Atkins isn't expected to miss any significant time due to 
the injury.    

 Wesley Person , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Person was activated from the injured list on Tuesday after missing 
Cleveland's last eight games with an elbow injury. Before the injury, Person 
was averaging 7.4 points and 3.6 rebounds per game. Person will likely split 
time with Trajan Langdon, which diminishes what little Fantasy value he may 
have had.     

 Cherokee Parks , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Parks has been traded once again, this time to the Los Angeles Clippers. He 

"
"was averaging 3.7 points and 3.1 rebounds as Jahidi White's backup in 
Washington.  Parks holds no Fantasy value.  

 Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Clippers waived Ekezie today, just one day after the team acquired him 
from the Washington Wizards. He likely won't have any Fantasy value anywhere 
he ends up this season, as he's averaging just 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in 
10 games thus far.  

 Jermaine O'Neal , F IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/29/00 
 O'Neal was held out of the starting lineup because he was late for a team 
plane Monday.  He had started his team's first 12 games.  He still managed to 
post another double-double, scoring 17 points and grabbing 11 rebounds.  
O'Neal should be back in the starting lineup for Thursday's game at Golden 
State.    

 Jason Collier , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Collier had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Tuesday and will be out 
4-to-6 weeks.  With reserves Collier and Kelvin Cato injured, the Rockets 
will now have to search for a backup for C Hakeem Olajuwon.    

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Sabonis re-injured his left knee when he stepped on teammate Scottie 
Pippen's foot in the first quarter against Seattle on Tuesday night.  The 
extent of his latest injury is not known yet and Sabonis is listed as 
day-to-day.  He missed the first eight games of the season after arthroscopic 
surgery on the knee revealed torn cartilage.   Dale Davis will replace 
Sabonis in the starting lineup if he is unable to play.     

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Washington Wizards acquired Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday 
for forwards Cherokee Parks and Obinna Ekezie, both of whom came to the 
Wizards in an August 22 deal for center Isaac Austin. Nesby, who was third on 
the Clippers in scoring at 7.7 ppg, should immediately assume the small 
forward position for Washington.  

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/28/00 
 Geiger has been diagnosed with developing tendinitis in his right thigh, 
less than one week since he returned to action after undergoing knee surgery 
in the offseason.  The Sixers' center is listed as day to day. For those 
Fantasy owners who grabbed Geiger upon his return, it is time to put him on 
the shelf once again until he is healthy.   

 Erick Dampier , C GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/28/00 
 Dampier didn't practice on Monday because of soreness in his left knee.  He 
has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 10.4 points and 7.2 
rebounds per game for Golden State. Despite his condition, he is expected to 
play against the Clippers on Wednesday night.    

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Barros will likely be activated off the injured list in time for Wednesday's 
game against the Nets.  He will replace Cedric Ceballos, who was traded to 
Miami, on the Pistons' roster.  Barros likely won't see enough playing time 
to be very productive, so his Fantasy value is very slim.     

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 With the addition of Joe Smith, the Pistons are now reportedly shopping 
Williams.  The Detroit Free Press is reporting that Detroit is talking to the 
Los Angeles Clippers about a deal that would involve Williams and both Corey 
Maggette and Tyrone Nesby.  Williams has been a decent Fantasy player thus 
far, averaging 7.8 points and 8.4 rebounds over his first 14 games.  A trade 
to the Clippers would increase Williams' Fantasy value, so you may want to 
consider him for your roster if the deal becomes a reality.    

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/28/00 
 Miami Heat Head Coach Pat Riley plans to give Ceballos a course in 
motivation, adding that he wants the veteran forward to re-capture his 
scoring touch to help Miami get back on the winning track.  ""If he gets his 
mindset back to really being what he was last year and even a couple of years 
ago - that he is a real valued member of a rotation and is needed - that will 
inspire him,"" said Riley. If Riley's tactics work, Ceballos' Fantasy value 
could rise significantly, so keep your eyes on the box scores over the next 
few days.    

 Jonathan Kerner , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Kerner, who had missed all 14 of the Knicks' games this season, was waived 
by the team on Monday.  He has been hampered by patella tendinitis in his 
right knee, and became expendable when the Knicks signed guard Rick Brunson.  
Kerner was of no Fantasy value.    

 Rick Brunson , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Knicks on Monday, replacing the injured Charlie 
Ward on the roster.  Brunson appeared in 54 games for New York from 
1998-2000.  He was signed as a free agent by the Celtics this season but was 
waived on Nov. 21.  He averaged only 3.7 points and 3.4 assists in 20.3 
minutes per game in Boston.  Brunson's numbers likely won't improve with the 
Knicks, so don't waste a roster spot in him.  

 Stromile Swift , G VAN - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Swift is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks after 
suffering an ankle injury.  He hasn't been too productive lately since being 
removed from the regular frontcourt rotation.   

 Kevin Edwards , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Edwards is suffering from a thumb injury and is questionable for Monday's 
road game against the Knicks.  If he is unable to play Doug West will 
probably start at shooting guard.

College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31.
""The end zones were confusing,"" says Slocum.  ""I'm sure that some of the
touchdowns that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours. We
were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored
thirty-five points.  There's no way we lost this one.  A&M demands a
recount.""

Oklahoma officials are calling this ""outrageous"".  ""They agreed to the size,

shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off,"" replies OU
coach Bob Stoops.  ""If they had a problem with them, they should have said
so before we started.  You don't get to keep playing until you're happy
with the outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five
points many times.""

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well
as that darn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.
""We are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the
winner of the game,"" says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end  zones

were used.  ""They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,""

says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside
bearing signs such as, ""A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!""  Students'
thoughts echoed their signs.  ""All we want is a fair total of the points
before we declare a winner,"" says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.
""We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a
winner.""

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,
despite
the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point.  At about 2:30 pm, with
the
game still too close to call, ABC had to back off its prediction.

College Football analyst Brent Musburger made the call.  ""We felt that with
a number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies,
we were certain A&M would carry this game.  We may have been premature in
our prediction.""






Our game is at 8 this week.  Can you make it?  This is the last week of the

They don't have to accept hand recounts
Ladies and Gentlemen,

We plan to upgrade the two NT servers that run Gas TDS's middle-tier 
applications this weekend.  Therefore, TDS will not be available between 
12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, December 10th, 2000.  If this downtime is 
in conflict with your schedule, please let me know ASAP.

I would also like to point out to you that when TDS is brought back on line, 
it will be necessary for all the desks to be reloaded.  Since we introduced 
the TDS Flag last month, this should not effect any of the desks.

Thank you for your cooperations,
Kenny H.
Warning- it has sound.

I've seen those exact same quotes attributed to everyone from Bill Clinton to

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00 
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his 
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson, 

"
"underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is 
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.   

 Kenny Anderson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 The Celtics activated Anderson on Sunday and placed guard Chris Carr on the 
injured list with a sprained left ankle.   Anderson had been on the injured 
list since Nov. 6 with a fractured jaw. He had a wire removed from his jaw 
Dec. 6 and was cleared to practice Dec. 7. He missed 16 games with the 
injury.    

 Erick Strickland , G NY - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Strickland sat out Saturday's home game against Denver due to a bruised 
leg.  He was a valuable Fantasy player as a member of the Dallas Mavericks 
last season but is limited now by his lack of playing time with the Knicks.   
 

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Davis missed his second straight start for the Sonics because of a sprained 
ankle. Forward Ruben Patterson started in place of Davis, with Rashard Lewis 
moving to shooting guard.  Davis is a solid ballhandler and defender but 
doesn't have much Fantasy value.    

 Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primarily 
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value.  

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game at 
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use in 
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.    

 Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley.  
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily as 
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value.  

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a 
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven 
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the 
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotation 
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.     

 Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He 
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will 
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positive 
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt 
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder under 
the current conditions.    

 Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injured 
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing 
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.     

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur 
on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rookie 
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for 
Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined 
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of the 
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.     

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return to 
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  ""Oak,"" who was 
suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy value 
as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deeper 
leagues.    

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00 
 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though 
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State 
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting about 
the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn 
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the very 
latest, so add a little ""Vinsanity"" to your starting lineup next week.    

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00 
 Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The 
Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court on 
Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers. 
Hill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights 
this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, give 
Hill the start this week pending any setbacks.    

 Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00 
 Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for 
Friday's game against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but 
has very little Fantasy value.     

 Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00 
 Nash returned to action against the Knicks Wednesday after missing two 
straight games because of a calf injury.  He didn't seem to be bothered by 
the injury as he scored 14 points and dished off for six assists.  It is now 
safe to play Nash on your Fantasy team again.     

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00 
 Marshall is recovering from a sprained knee and is questionable for 
Thursday's game against the Grizzlies.  Look for starters Bryon Russell and 
Karl Malone to play extra minutes in his absence.  Avoid using Marshall until 
he appears to be fully recovered.    

 Kevin Garnett , F MIN - Farragut Academy Updated 12/07/00 
 Garnett hurt his right ring finger in Tuesday's game and was scheduled to 
have it examined Wednesday.  He is expected to play against the Wizards 
Thursday.  Monitor Garnett's situation.  Something as simple as an injured 
finger on his shooting hand could lead to an offensive slump and affect his 
Fantasy numbers.    

 Terry Davis , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00 
 Davis will be eligible to come off the injured list Sunday but Achilles 
tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep him sidelined a little bit 
longer.  He has been injury prone throughout his career and doesn't have much 
Fantasy value.    

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00 
 McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday's game against the Heat 
and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against the Magic.  Keon Clark 
will start at power forward if McDyess is unable to play.  The leg is sore 
now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few days.    

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00 
 Hill may be ready to return to the court for Thursday night's game against 
the Nuggets. He has missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he 
practiced on Wednesday, and all indications signal his return to the court. 
""I can't give you the official thumbs up,"" said Head Coach Doc Rivers, ""but 
it looks good."" Fantasy owners who have been waiting for Hill's return will 
likely get him back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a 
four-game West Coast road trip.   

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00 
 According to The Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful 
that Trent will travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing on 
the East Coast.  Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but could 
be back in action in another two weeks.  He has been sidelined since the 
first preseason game with a strained upper abductor muscle.  Trent is a good 
inside scorer and a solid rebounder but is injury prone.  When he does return 
Fantasy owners should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately 
need a forward.     

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00 
 Marbury missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of an 
ankle injury. He turned the ankle last  Friday night in Orlando, then turned 
it again the following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is 
still lacking some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankle 
is diminishing. Marbury hopes to return on Friday night when the Nets host 
the Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have their 
star point guard back in time for next week's roster changes.  

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00 
 Carter was in uniform for Wednesday night's game against Portland, but he 
didn't see any playing time. ""Air Canada"" said that he felt well enough to 
play, but team doctors wouldn't give him permission to get in the game. ""We'd 
like to have him back as soon as possible,"" said Head Coach Lenny Wilkens, 
""but we're not going to bring him back before he's ready."" Toronto finishes 
their three-game West Coast swing on Friday night against Golden State, at 
which time Carter hopes to make his return. The Raptors' star should be back 
before Monday, so most Fantasy owners can re-insert him into their lineup in 
time for next week.    

 Andre Miller , G CLE - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00 
 Miller took a knee to the nose during Wednesday night's game at Chicago 
which sent him to the bench temporarily. He returned to the game with a 
vengeance, finishing with 20 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in 
Cleveland's 92-88 victory. The shot to the nose won't keep Miller from 
missing any playing time, so continue to use the young point guard in your 
starting lineup.    

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00 
 Brand missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night against 
Cleveland. He is reportedly making progress with his hyperextended left knee, 
and has been able to run on a treadmill this week.  Brand is listed as day to 
day, and says that he has about a 50 percent chance of playing on Friday 
night against Dallas. With most roster changes occurring on Monday, Fantasy 
owners should be able to put the Bulls' star back in their lineup for next 
week's games.   

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/06/00 
 The 76ers will be without Snow for six to eight weeks after a CT scan 
Wednesday showed a stress fracture in his right ankle. He was second on the 
team with a career-high 12.2 ppg, and led the Sixers with 6.6 assists per 
contest. Although Philadelphia sports a deep roster, one can't help but 
assume this will have an impact on the team's fortunes for Fantasy purposes.  

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00 
 Dudley will travel with the Suns on their end of the week road-trip that 
starts in Milwaukee Thursday.  He will most likely be questionable for all 
the games.  Look for him to finally return to action next week.  With Dudley 
out of the lineup Corie Blount and rookie Daniel Santiago will continue to 
get playing time.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley's rebounding 
makes him a starter on your Fantasy team if you are using a reserve in his 
position.    

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00 
 Mills is doubtful for Wednesday's game against the Lakers because of pain in 
his right ankle.  He was scheduled to see a foot specialist on Tuesday and 
underwent surgery last season to remove bone spurs from the ankle.  Sit Mills 
on your Fantasy bench for now.  If you are playing in a small league drop him 
from your roster and add another forward.     

 Ron Mercer , G CHI - The Old School Fools Updated 12/06/00 
 Mercer sat out of Tuesday's game against the T'Wolves because of the flu.  
Corey Benjamin started at shooting guard in place of Mercer.  Mercer's status 
for Wednesday's game is up in the air.  He has been a major disappointment so 
far this season.  If you play in a deep Fantasy league keep him on your 
roster, if you are in a smaller one look to make an upgrade at guard.  The 
way Mercer has been producing you shouldn't have a hard time finding a better 
guard.

Today, a Florida judge supported FL Secretary of State Katherine
Harris' decision to reject hand-counted votes submitted after
the November 14 statewide county certification deadline.  The
judge, a Democrat, found Harris had exercised proper discretion.

Governor Bush believes the way to conclude this election, in a
fair, accurate and final way, is for the state of Florida to
count the remaining overseas ballots, add them to the certified
vote, and announce the results, as required by Florida law.

Florida citizens are ready for and will accept this result,
according to two new polls.

According to a new Mason-Dixon poll,  71% of Floridians believe
waiting to declare a winner by the end of this weekend is
ACCEPTABLE, while 60% believe waiting several weeks to declare
a winner is TOO LONG TO WAIT.

Furthermore, according to a new NBC/WSJ poll, 81% will accept
George W. Bush as winner based on the overseas absentee ballots
count plus the current machine tally.

-------------------

Meanwhile, the Gore campaign says they want a full, fair and
accurate count, but today, the LA Times reports on how they
hope to achieve their real objectives...

SEASONED DEMOCRATIC ARMY HITS THE SHORES OF FLORIDA
excerpts from The Los Angeles Times:

""To scrounge for every last vote, Gore has flooded Fort
Lauderdale with tough, seasoned Democrats, the sort who are
used to keeping wafflers in line and to count and recount
votes until they know exactly what it will take to outdo their
opponents. Many of the hired hands speak with a Boston brogue...

""Not far away, in an abandoned Payless shoe store, vanloads of
AFL-CIO staffers and Gore loyalists from New York, Chicago,
Nashville, Philadelphia, San Francisco and elsewhere had
disembarked to learn how to observe the ballot count.

""'Our goal,' said one lawyer as he patiently lectured his new
charges, 'is to preserve the Al Gore vote.'  The volunteers
nodded. 'It's very, very important that if you see any kind of
mark--a scratch, a dent, a pinprick in Al Gore's column--that
you challenge.'   When someone then asked what they should do
if they found a Bush ballot with an indent, the lawyer said:
'Keep your lips sealed.'  It was hardball that the Bostonians
and other imported pros understood well.""

Hi Folks,

We've been downgrading Chicago WR Marcus Robinson already with Shane
Matthews throwing the ball but here's more bad news from my friends at
www.nfltalk.com

http://www.sportstalk.com/nfl/rumors/index.shtml From the article:  The
Chicago Bears have informed NFLtalk that wide receiver Marcus Robinson
suffered a lower back strain with muscle spasms in practice yesterday. He

"
"was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment and observation
last night and was evaluated by Bears team orthopedist Michael Schafer.
Robinson is listed on the Bears injury report as questionable for this
weekend's game with Green Bay and his status will be updated tomorrow.

More as I hear it but right now it's not looking too good.



Joe

Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
Latest NBA Player News Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00The 
Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primarily as 
Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value.  Chris Dudley , C PHO - 
Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Dudley was activated from the injured list and 
started in Thursday's game at Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, 
Dudley could be of good use in a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in 
a smaller one.    Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Garces 
was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley.  Garces is 
suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily as a third 
center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value.  Donyell Marshall , F UTA - 
Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Marshall had missed the two games prior to 
Thursday's action because of a sprained knee, but returned to the lineup 
against Vancouver and had seven points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  
Because Marshall comes off the bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But 
with him back in the rotation forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will 
play less minutes now.     Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 
12/08/00Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained 
knee.  He is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence 
will force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have 
positive or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston 
frontcourt players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or 
flounder under the current conditions.    Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent 
Updated 12/08/00Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room 
for the injured Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive 
enough playing time to be a valuable Fantasy player.     Greg Buckner , G DAL 
- Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to 
remove a cracked bone spur on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline 
Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rookie Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured 
list to make room for Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he 
has been sidelined with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner 
for he rest of the season or until he is playing and producing on a 
consistent basis again.     Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 
12/08/00Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to 
return to the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  
""Oak,"" who was suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has 
Fantasy value as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity 
outside of deeper leagues.    Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 
12/08/00Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as 
though Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden 
State Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting 
about the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn 
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the very 
latest, so add a little ""Vinsanity"" to your starting lineup next week.    
Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00Hill was a game time scratch on 
Thursday night against the Nuggets. The Orlando Sentinel is reporting that 
Hill is expected to return to the court on Monday when the Magic travel to 
Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers. Hill's return is long overdue for 
Fantasy owners who held onto his rights this season. Unless you have a number 
of solid forwards on your roster, give Hill the start this week pending any 
setbacks.    Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00Turkoglu 
is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for Friday's game 
against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but has very little 
Fantasy value.     Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00Nash 
returned to action against the Knicks Wednesday after missing two straight 
games because of a calf injury.  He didn't seem to be bothered by the injury 
as he scored 14 points and dished off for six assists.  It is now safe to 
play Nash on your Fantasy team again.     Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free 
Agent Updated 12/07/00Marshall is recovering from a sprained knee and is 
questionable for Thursday's game against the Grizzlies.  Look for starters 
Bryon Russell and Karl Malone to play extra minutes in his absence.  Avoid 
using Marshall until he appears to be fully recovered.    Kevin Garnett , F 
MIN - Farragut Academy Updated 12/07/00Garnett hurt his right ring finger in 
Tuesday's game and was scheduled to have it examined Wednesday.  He is 
expected to play against the Wizards Thursday.  Monitor Garnett's situation.  
Something as simple as an injured finger on his shooting hand could lead to 
an offensive slump and affect his Fantasy numbers.    Terry Davis , F DEN - 
Free Agent Updated 12/07/00Davis will be eligible to come off the injured 
list Sunday but Achilles tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep him 
sidelined a little bit longer.  He has been injury prone throughout his 
career and doesn't have much Fantasy value.    Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The 
Rounders Updated 12/07/00McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday's 
game against the Heat and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against the 
Magic.  Keon Clark will start at power forward if McDyess is unable to play.  
The leg is sore now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few 
days.    Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00Hill may be ready to 
return to the court for Thursday night's game against the Nuggets. He has 
missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he practiced on 
Wednesday, and all indications signal his return to the court. ""I can't give 
you the official thumbs up,"" said Head Coach Doc Rivers, ""but it looks good."" 
Fantasy owners who have been waiting for Hill's return will likely get him 
back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a four-game West Coast 
road trip.   Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00According to The 
Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful that Trent will 
travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing on the East Coast.  
Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but could be back in action 
in another two weeks.  He has been sidelined since the first preseason game 
with a strained upper abductor muscle.  Trent is a good inside scorer and a 
solid rebounder but is injury prone.  When he does return Fantasy owners 
should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately need a forward.    
 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00Marbury missed 
his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of an ankle injury. He 
turned the ankle last  Friday night in Orlando, then turned it again the 
following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is still lacking 
some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankle is 
diminishing. Marbury hopes to return on Friday night when the Nets host the 
Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have their 
star point guard back in time for next week's roster changes.  Vince Carter , 
G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00Carter was in uniform for Wednesday 
night's game against Portland, but he didn't see any playing time. ""Air 
Canada"" said that he felt well enough to play, but team doctors wouldn't give 
him permission to get in the game. ""We'd like to have him back as soon as 
possible,"" said Head Coach Lenny Wilkens, ""but we're not going to bring him 
back before he's ready."" Toronto finishes their three-game West Coast swing 
on Friday night against Golden State, at which time Carter hopes to make his 
return. The Raptors' star should be back before Monday, so most Fantasy 
owners can re-insert him into their lineup in time for next week.    Andre 
Miller , G CLE - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00Miller took a knee to the nose 
during Wednesday night's game at Chicago which sent him to the bench 
temporarily. He returned to the game with a vengeance, finishing with 20 
points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in Cleveland's 92-88 victory. The shot 
to the nose won't keep Miller from missing any playing time, so continue to 
use the young point guard in your starting lineup.    Elton Brand , F CHI - 
Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00Brand missed his second consecutive game on 
Wednesday night against Cleveland. He is reportedly making progress with his 
hyperextended left knee, and has been able to run on a treadmill this week.  
Brand is listed as day to day, and says that he has about a 50 percent chance 
of playing on Friday night against Dallas. With most roster changes occurring 
on Monday, Fantasy owners should be able to put the Bulls' star back in their 
lineup for next week's games.   Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 
12/06/00The 76ers will be without Snow for six to eight weeks after a CT scan 
Wednesday showed a stress fracture in his right ankle. He was second on the 
team with a career-high 12.2 ppg, and led the Sixers with 6.6 assists per 
contest. Although Philadelphia sports a deep roster, one can't help but 
assume this will have an impact on the team's fortunes for Fantasy purposes.  
Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Dudley will travel with the 
Suns on their end of the week road-trip that starts in Milwaukee Thursday.  
He will most likely be questionable for all the games.  Look for him to 
finally return to action next week.  With Dudley out of the lineup Corie 
Blount and rookie Daniel Santiago will continue to get playing time.  With 
the lack of depth at center, Dudley's rebounding makes him a starter on your 
Fantasy team if you are using a reserve in his position.    Chris Mills , F 
GS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Mills is doubtful for Wednesday's game 
against the Lakers because of pain in his right ankle.  He was scheduled to 
see a foot specialist on Tuesday and underwent surgery last season to remove 
bone spurs from the ankle.  Sit Mills on your Fantasy bench for now.  If you 
are playing in a small league drop him from your roster and add another 
forward.     Ron Mercer , G CHI - The Old School Fools Updated 12/06/00Mercer 
sat out of Tuesday's game against the T'Wolves because of the flu.  Corey 
Benjamin started at shooting guard in place of Mercer.  Mercer's status for 
Wednesday's game is up in the air.  He has been a major disappointment so far 
this season.  If you play in a deep Fantasy league keep him on your roster, 
if you are in a smaller one look to make an upgrade at guard.  The way Mercer 
has been producing you shouldn't have a hard time finding a better guard.    
Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Williams sprained his 
ankle in Tuesday's game against the Grizzlies and is questionable for 
Wednesday's contest at Seattle.  The ankle will probably limit Williams' 
production in the next few games so use a healthy forward instead.    Billy 
Owens , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Owens strained his right biceps in 
Tuesday's game against Vancouver.  He has actually been productive this 
season when healthy, but don't gamble on him.  Owens has been injury prone 
throughout his career and is too risky a player to take a chance on.  Use a 
more durable player instead.     Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated 
12/06/00Smith got his first start as a Piston Tuesday at power forward.  He 
scored 12 points and grabbed eight rebounds.  With his promotion into the 
starting lineup it is now safe to start Smith on your Fantasy team.  With an 
increased role Smith will be a consistent rebounder and scorer.    John 
Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Wallace was placed on the 
injured list due to tendonitis in his left knee.  He is a good offensive 
player but his shortcomings on defense have limited his playing time.  His 
lack of playing time prevents him from being a productive Fantasy player so 
avoid using him in your league     More Updates 

Player News?Teams? 
Farragut Academy Player News Lamar Odom , Reserve FUpdated 10/26/00Head coach 
Alvin Gentry is considering playing Odom at the point guard position. This 
move would allow Gentry to play swingmen Darius Miles, Eric Piatkowski, Corey 
Maggette, Quentin Richardson, and Tyrone Nesby more frequently. Odom played 
point guard last season and is an exceptional ballhandler for his size. The 
shift for Odom is expected to begin Friday when he suits up for the preseason 
finale against Seattle. Odom had missed four consecutive preseason games due 
to a bruised left quadriceps.  Kenyon Martin , Reserve FUpdated 10/25/00Nets' 
Head Coach Byron Scott sat Martin down this week and insisted that he step up 
his game on a nightly basis. The talk may have worked, as Martin scored 14 
points and collected 11 rebounds in 33 minutes of work, but the Nets still 
fell to the Knicks, 91-80.  Darius Miles , Injured FUpdated 11/16/00Miles did 
not play in Wednesday's game against the Knicks. Head coach Alvin Gentry 
chose to go with a more experienced lineup and started Tyrone Nesby at 
shooting guard. Keep and eye on this situation. This could lead to a 
diminished role for Miles.  Larry Hughes , Active GUpdated 10/16/00Shooting 
guard Larry Hughes displayed his athleticism Sunday against Portland by 
scoring 16 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. Don't hesitate to select Hughes 
in the middle rounds of your Fantasy draft. This 21-year old is extremely 
talented.  Michael Olowokandi , Reserve CUpdated 10/19/00Starting center 
Michael Olowokandi will sit out Thursday's preseason game against the Nuggets 
to rest his sore ankle. Camp invitee Zendon Hamilton will get a chance to 
prove his worth to the club as he slides into the starting spot in place of 
Olowokandi.  Travis Best , Active GUpdated 10/24/00Best returned to the floor 
for the first time this preseason on Monday night, and proceeded to have a 
huge game for the Pacers. He scored 19 points, dished out seven assists and 
collected five rebounds in 40 minutes of play. He will be Indiana's starting 
point guard when the season opens on October 31st.  Shawn Bradley , Active 
CUpdated 11/02/00Bradley will replace Christian Laettner in the starting 
lineup at center for Thursday's game. Head coach Don Nelson was impressed 
with Bradley's effort in the season opener in which he scored six points 
grabbed five rebounds and had six blocks in 20 minutes.  Sam Cassell , 
Reserve GUpdated 03/02/00Cassell had a night to forget. He had 8 points and 8 
assists on 2-of-10 shooting.  Danny Fortson , Reserve FUpdated 
11/23/00Fortson had successful surgery on his broken right foot Wednesday, 
and will be sidelined for at least two months. He had been leading the NBA in 
rebounding when he suffered the injury, and was placed on the injured list 
November 15. His rehabilitation program will consist of an immobilization of 
the foot for about eight weeks, after which point he will enter the final 
phase of recovery. Fortson will likely not return to the Warriors until after 
the All-Star break.  Kevin Garnett , Active FUpdated 12/07/00Garnett hurt his 
right ring finger in Tuesday's game and was scheduled to have it examined 
Wednesday. He is expected to play against the Wizards Thursday. Monitor 
Garnett's situation. Something as simple as an injured finger on his shooting 
hand could lead to an offensive slump and affect his Fantasy numbers.  Tracy 
McGrady , Reserve GUpdated 11/30/00McGrady returned to action on Wednesday 
night after missing two games with an infected hand. He played the game with 
his hand wrapped in a bandage, but it didn't effect his production. The 
Orlando star scored 28 points and pulled down seven boards in losing to Utah 
88-86. McGrady should continue to be a Fantasy stud as the NBA season 
progresses.  Jermaine O'Neal , Active FUpdated 11/29/00O'Neal was held out of 
the starting lineup because he was late for a team plane Monday. He had 
started his team's first 12 games. He still managed to post another 
double-double, scoring 17 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. O'Neal should be 
back in the starting lineup for Thursday's game at Golden State.  Jalen Rose 
, Active GUpdated 11/20/00Rose his hoping to make his season debut on Tuesday 
night against the Rockets, but he's not making any promises. He was suppose 
to return to action last week, but the team's medical personnel advised him 
to wait a bit longer before hitting the court. If Rose is on your roster, 
give him at least another week before putting him into your starting lineup.

the last game of the regular season as earlier  reported.

start this week.

deactivated this week. Brad Hoover again starts in his  place.

contribute more this week as Chad Morton and Jerald Moore are both listed as

healthy.

RB Richie Anderson (NYJ) is expected to  play with a sore finger.

RB Tyrone Wheatley  (Oak) has a broken finger on his left hand and is being

expected to  start.

RB Chris Warren was signed by the  Eagles.

expects to start this week.

expected to play the rest of this  season.

RB Mike Alstott (TB) is out with a sore  knee. Warrick Dunn continues to get

week and have a lot of  opportunities.

WR David Boston (Ari) missed practice  on Wednesday with a sore hamstring. He 
is not listed on the injury report though  and expects to play this week.

WR Jermaine Lewis (Bal) practiced  through the pain of sore ribs and will 
likely play this week.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out with a broken  fibula. Willie Jackson plays in his  
absence. 

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) practiced both  Wednesday and Thursday , but is still 
questionable to start. He is having  difficulty breathing so even if he does

will start in his place.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ) is expected to  play with a bruised throat.

WR Courtney Hawkins (Pit) missed  practice on Wednesday with a sore knee and 
remains questionable for the weekend  game.

WR Hines Ward (Pit) is expected to play  with his sore ankle.

WR Jeff Graham (SD) missed Wednesday,s  practice and is listed as doubtful on 
the injury report. If he cannot go, look  for Trevor Gaylor to start in his  
absence.

100%. He does not appear on the injury  report this week. He will start.

WR/KR Tony Horne (StL) is out this  week.

practice on Wednesday, but expects to practice  later in the week and play on 
Sunday.

TE OJ Santiago (Cle) is not expected to  see much playing time with his new 
team with a sore knee. He is listed as  questionable this week. The fact that 
he is playing for his third team this  season makes him look ""suspect and 
questionable"" to me.

TE Desmond Clark (Den) practiced on  Thursday with a cast on his forearm. He 
is expected to play on  Sunday.

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ) is expected to  play with a sore neck.

TE Mark Bruener (Pit) is expected to  play through his aches and pains.

Hi  Folks

It's crunch time so  let's jump right into our  Upgraded and Downgraded 
Players.? As we head down the home  stretch, identifying those players moving 
up or down can be the difference  between?dominating the playoffs or watching 
from the sidelines.? As we head into our 15th week  of listing these players, 
it,s inevitable that some guys will have made both the  upgrade or downgrade 
list.? Make  sure you understand, what we,re talking about is players that 
are moving.? In other words, a player like TE Ricky  Dudley could appear on 
the downgrade list and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.? 
It just  means I,m concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Likewise, 
a player like WR Willie  Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he,s 
still fairly far down the  list of WRs.? It,s all about which  direction 
players are moving.?  Keeping an eye on these trends as they can very often 
make all the  difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or 
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this 
week.

QBs Moving  Up?

QB Aaron Brooks  (NO)? We keep hyping the kid and he keeps delivering.?  
Another outstanding game Sunday where he rolled up 441 yards and 2 TDs as he  
went 30 for 48.? The Saints rushing game is clearly struggling so it  appears 
Brooks will continue to air the ball out.? Yes, he'll make some  young QB 
mistakes and I'd be surprised if he didn't throw as many interceptions  as he 
does TDs.? I expect him to throw a lot of both.? I almost  started him over 
Peyton Manning in my local league but didn't pull the  trigger.? Manning was 
solid but Brooks was better.

QB Kordell Stewart  (Pit)? Kordell made our upgrade list last week and here 
he sits  again.? It took a few years, but he's showing folks that maybe 1997 
was no  fluke.? He showed guts coming back in the game after being knocked 
out with  a bad knee or calf (depending on whether you listen to coach Bill 
Cowher or  Stewart)? The TD rush was highlight material.? His problem all 
along  seems to have been confidence and he's surely brimming with it now.? 
Kent  Graham was so bad I won't even mention him in the downgrades but he put 
on a  horrid display when he was in the game.? He's  awful.

QB Jay Fiedler  (Mia)? Dan Fouts said on Monday Night Football a few weeks 
ago  that a nice pass just thrown by Fiedler ""was as pretty as anything Dan 
Marino  ever threw"".? Fiedler has those moments and he was having them fairly 
often  against the supposedly tough Bills where they were supposedly going to 
have an  advantage in their cold weather.? Didn't play out that way.? 
Fiedler  looks pretty darn good.

QB Jeff Garcia  (SF)? We had him high in week 14 like we have all year and 
he  didn't disappoint.? WR Terrell Owens was a huge help and apparently 
Jerry  Rice's wife?harping on the radio had some sort of positive effect.?  
The Chargers had been very tough against the pass and Garcia shredded  them.

QB Brett Favre  (GB)? I have a hard time putting a finger on it but this guy 
just  does what it takes to get the job done.? He'd be much better off if WR  
Antonio Freeman earned 10% of his paycheck but in the meantime, Bill 
Schroeder's  doing a great job.? 

QB Jeff George  (Was)? Lil Danny Snyder removed the primary obstacle to 
keeping  his QB Jeff George off the field by firing Norv Turner Monday.? 
George  looks to start this week and possibly for the rest of the year.? 
Although  tying Snyder to anything past the next series is a stretch.? I'm a 
Jeff  George fan though and he does give the team a big arm.? We'll see how 
it  goes but at least it looks as if he'll get his shot.

?

RBs Moving  Up

RB Mike Anderson  (Den)? Like you need me to tell you this.? The fact that 
he  ran buck wild on a tough New Orleans defense made the effort all the 
more  impressive.? He bruised a knee but seemed to bounce back and looks to 
be  good for Sunday.? Clearly, the Denver OL is the star on this team so if 
you  own Anderson, it's probably not a bad idea to grab KaRon Coleman for the 
stretch  run.? 

RB Fred Taylor  (Jac)? For all the early?ripping I've done to Taylor, he's  
performed just as we predicted he would lately - like a madman.? You don't  
need me to tell you he's been awesome.

RB Warrick Dunn  (TB)? Can the little guy take up the slack for Mike 
Alstott??  I've got a couple hundred reasons that says ""yes"".? Ok, rushing 
for 200+  against Dallas is nothing special (it's happened in 23% of the 
Cowboys games  this year) but you have to admit Dunn looked great  Sunday.?

RB Corey Dillon  (Cin)? One can only salivate about what he might do if he 
played  for a team like Denver.? The fact he can continue to roll up huge 
yardage  on this team is amazing.? New QB Scott Mitchell is a huge boost as 
he looks  like Peyton Manning back there compared to Akili  Smith...

RB Ahman Green  (GB)? Green's a guy that's finally living up to his  
potential.? You always knew he had the physical skills but now he seems to  
be catching up mentally as well.? He showed a nice nose for the endzone  
Sunday with the 2 TDs.

RB Lamar Smith  (Mia)? So much for the cold weather hamstring worries.? 
Smith  carried the load Sunday in frigid Buffalo and looked great.? It looks 
to me  like he's picking up right where he left off.

RB Terrell Fletcher  (SD)? It's not exactly the same as earning the starting 
RB job in  Tennessee or Indianapolis, but Fletcher does seem to have nailed 
down the #1 RB  slot in San Diego.? And that's worth something.? You have to 
decide  how much...

RB Fred Beasley  (SF)? We loved Beasley early in the season as he racked up  
TDs.? He got back in the mix Sunday with 5 carries and a TD.? The FB  for San 
Francisco has always been a valuable FF slot and Beasley might be worth  the 
roll of the dice if you're thin at RB.

RB Shawn Bryson  (Buf)? Finally, Bryson does something besides make me look 
bad for  hyping him.? He rolled up 88 yards on just 12 attempts Sunday and 
looks to  take advantage of Sammy Morris' ankle troubles.? 

RB Terry Allen  (NO)? Allen made an appearance Sunday and with Jerald Moore 
and  Chad Morton failing to astound anyone, Allen could get more looks.? 
Whether  he's got anything left in the tank remains to be seen.

?

WRs Moving  Up

WR David Boston  (Ari)?? Boston turned in a huge game Sunday and has to be  
considered an upgrade.? He's a streaky guy but with Frank Sanders a total  
non factor, Boston is getting most of QB Jake Plummer's attention these  
days.? And with Arizona almost certain to be playing from behind, he could  
do some damage.

WR Darrell Jackson  (Sea)? Jackson was red hot several weeks ago but had 
cooled of  late.? He warmed up again Sunday with Jon Kitna under center.? 
It's  tough to depend on the Seahawk passing game but Jackson could be worth 
a  shot.

WR Curtis Conway  (SD)? Conway has benefited the most from the Ryan Leaf  
resurgence.? He caught 7 passes Sunday and should benefit as Leaf continues  
to improve.

WR Willie Jackson  (NO)? Jackson's officially moved past the ""flash in the 
pan"" stage  with another solid day.? Aaron Brooks continues to look good at 
QB.?  Jackson may suffer a bit when Jake Reed gets healthy but for right now, 
he's  looking good.

WR Joe Horn  (NO)? Again, QB Aaron Brooks delivers and Horn is the prime  
recipient.? Joe Horn is one of the better stories of 2000 and he should  
continue to shine especially if the rushing game doesn't get  untracked.

WR Bobby Shaw  (Pit)? Shaw may still be available in your league as the 
starting  WR opposite Hines Ward.? He found the endzone again and continues 
to make  some noise with Kordell Stewart quarterbacking.

WR Terrell Owens  (SF)? The best news for Jeff Garcia owners had to be a 
solid day  from Terrell Owens.? He's a huge boost to the offense when he can 
go and it  looked like he'd made progress with the toe.? Keep an eye out for 
how he  responds after the game but I liked what I saw.

WR Shockmain Davis  (NE)? Ok, I'll be honest.? I'm pretty much just including 
him  here because he's the owner of the coolest name in the  league...

?

TEs Moving  Up

TE Dwayne Carswell  (Den)? Carswell's finally starting to emerge as the TE of 
choice  in Denver.? His 62 yards Sunday were second only to San Diego's 
Freddie  Jones.? You have to worry about Desmond Clark stealing time but I'd 
have no  trouble starting Carswell each week.

TE Reggie Kelly  (Atl)? One of the few bright spots for Atlanta has been the 
play  of Kelly.? He caught 4 passes for 44 yards Sunday with a TD.? New QB  
Doug Johnson may lean on him as he settles in.

TE Mark Bruener  (Pit)? Bruener makes the list not only for having another 
solid  game but for making one of the best TD runs after the catch Sunday as 
he piggy  backed a defender into the endzone after refusing to go down at the 
5 yard  line.

TE Andrew Glover  (NO)? Obviously, the play of Aaron Brooks raises the level 
of play  for all the Saints receivers.? Glover made a couple of nice plays 
Sunday  including a good looking TD catch.

?

Players Moving  Down

QBs Moving  Down

QB Shane Matthews  (Chi)? Take a seat Shane.? Cade McNown likely makes his  
return.? Folks can hardly wait...

QB Troy Aikman  (Dal)? Emmitt Smith owners had to love it but did it seem 
strange  to anyone else that the Cowboys felt the best way to come back from 
a huge  deficit against Tampa was to feed the ball to Emmitt?? Clearly, the 
team  has zero faith in Aikman's ability to throw the ball.

QB Shaun King  (TB)? I know he's had trouble with the back but 65 passing  
yards?? That's a joke.? He'll be better but I've seen  enough.

QB Brad Johnson  (Was)? It's the Jeff George show.? At least until?George  
looks bad for a few series...

QB Rob Johnson  (Buf)? In leagues that penalize for interceptions, you'd have 
been  better off starting yourself this weekend than you would've Rob 
Johnson.?  Once again, he starts the game but finishes holding a  clipboard.

?

RBs?Moving  Down

RB Jamal Anderson  (Atl)? Anderson's not playing too badly but the team is 
in  shambles.? After QB Chris Chandler was benched, Anderson vented some  
frustrations saying for all he knew, ""he might be punting this week"".? I  
don't think we'll see that but I also don't think we'll see the days of him  
seriously rushing the ball for the rest of the year.

RB Shaun Alexander  (Sea)?? RB Ricky Watters has proven to be less than an 
ideal  playmate refusing to share the ball.? Actually, he's played so well 
that  Mike Holmgren has been reluctant to do anything to disrupt the flow of 
his  star.? When the team is struggling as badly as it is, you don't mess 
with  the one thing that's working.

Philadelphia  RBs? Forget about them.? This team will live and die by  
Donovan McNabb.

RB Jermaine Fazande  (SD)? Evidently, Fazande is the 2nd choice behind 
Terrell Fletcher  now.? That's gotta hurt...

?

WRs Moving  Down

WR Joe Jurevicius  (NYG)? This has nothing to do with the play of Jurevicius 
as he's  been very solid but you have to think Ike Hilliard will be a factor 
when he  returns.? He's no lock to go this week but he may be  close.

WR Terrance Mathis  (Atl)? Mathis continues to struggle on a team that's in 
a  tailspin.? New QB Doug Johnson seemed to like throwing to Shawn Jefferson  
which could spell more bad things for Mathis.

WRs Torrance Small /  Charles Johnson (Phi)? Forget about it.? Donovan McNabb 
can  be a solid QB without WRs.

WRs James McKnight / Wayne  McGarity (Dal)? These guys just aren't very 
McGood.? QB Troy  Aikman is a mere shadow of his former self.

WR Marcus Robinson  (Chi)? Robinson's back troubles were apparently more 
serious than  many had expected.? It was announced Monday that he'll likely 
miss the rest  of the season with a bulging disk in his back.? It appears he 
can get by  without surgery but he's certainly not looking good.

?

TEs Moving  Down

TEs Marcus Pollard / Ken  Dilger (Ind)? Neither of these guys did much 
Sunday.? This  offense clearly isn't in the same groove it was earlier this 
year.?  

TEs Jackie Harris / David  LaFleur (Dal)? More bad news associated with Troy 
Aikman.?  Neither of these guys were much value Sunday and I don't see that 
changing very  quickly.

TE Pete Mitchell  (NYG)? One of the bigger disappointments at TE this season, 
he  just can't get untracked.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.  

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Christie was held without a point in last week's game against the Dolphins, 
but don't expect the same this week against the Colts. Christie is a solid 
Fantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between 
two teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.  

 Sylvester Morris , WR KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the 
Kansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics. ""I 
missed the majority of camp, so there's not that much wear and tear on me, 
but it's still a long season,"" he said. ""It's not so bad physically. But 
every morning I get up early, earlier than I ever had to in college. In 
college, you could schedule your classes. I never had a class before 10 
o'clock. Now I'm (at the practice facility) by 8 every day. That's a 
difference.""

Hi Folks,

Sorry to send another email but I've had a few AOL folks tell me the

REACTION TO GOVERNOR BUSH'S STATEMENT

RE: What Gore needs to consider:
""The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like, and
that Gore requested.  Bush still won counting with Gore's
rules... [Gore has] to consider where reasonable people in the
center are going to look at this, and say, 'Guys you had your
shot, the count, the recount - they changed the rules for you
and you still did not win.'  It's time to be magnanimous.

RE: Governor Bush's Speech:
""...the tone...was perfect...

""There was a persistence and a determination in what
[Governor Bush] said, but it was also incredibly conciliatory.
It was the first kind of conciliatory speech that anybody has
given in this, and that probably goes to peoples hearts.""

     - Bob Woodward on Larry King Live, CNN, 11/26/00

STATEMENT BY GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH

The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones.  As our
nation watched, we were all reminded on a daily basis of the
importance of each and every vote.  We were reminded of the
strength of our democracy - that while our system is not always
perfect, it is fundamentally strong and far better than any
other alternative.

The election was close, but tonight, after a count, a recount
and yet another manual recount, Secretary Cheney and I are
honored and humbled to have won the state of Florida, which
gives us the needed electoral votes to win the election.  We
will therefore undertake the responsibility of preparing to
serve as America's next President and Vice President.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Shortly after I arrived here some 19 days ago, I said here in
this very room that the election process in - Florida and in
the country as a whole - needed to conclude with fairness and
finality.

I suggested that everyone step back, pause, and think about
what was at stake.  I warned that there might be no reasonable
end to the process of counts, challenges and contests if it
slipped away from us.

So here is the account of the past 3 weeks.

STATEMENT BY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER BOB CRAWFORD
Democrat Member of Florida's Election Canvassing Commission

Thank you, Madam Secretary. Let me first commend you on the job
that you and your office have done during these last almost
three weeks since the election.

This has been a tough election. It has not always been pretty.
But we got the job done, and we got it done right. People
called me and say--particularly from out of state--and say
what's going on down in Florida, and I have to keep reminding
people, the only thing that's going on here is that we've got
a razor-thin election for the most important job in the world.

And that's all it is. After all the jokes, after all of the
anguish, we've just got a close election. And any state that
had to go through this would've had the same problems, I think,
that we have had.

But I think it's over. It should be over. And maybe that's the
important word there, ""should."" You know, Yogi Berra once said,
""It's not over till it's over.'' Well, it's over, and we have a
winner, and it's time to move on.

There's one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have
enough legal talent to keep this tied up through  Christmas.
But one thing the lawyers can't do for us and one thing the
courts can't do for us: They can't bring this country together
again.

And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight,
it's going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this
country together again, and I hope we can get on with that work
soon.

And I'm proud of the job that we've done here in the state.

GORE JUST SPINNING ABOUT SUPREME COURT, SAYS EXPERT
Fox News Channel, 11/26/00

FOX NEWS' BRIT HUME: ""...does the Gore team not have something
to work with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court
coming up on Friday.  That-that creates sort of a period of
continuing, a sort of unfinality if such a word exists.""

NATIONAL JOURNAL'S STUART TAYLOR: ""...Unless I'm missing
something that is completely hollow spin.  There is nothing
what so ever, I think-that the Supreme Court of the United
States can do for Al Gore.  They could do some things for
George W. Bush, but Al Gore hasn't asked them to do anything
except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done.
But I don't think he's in the position to say, ""Oh by the way
could you order some more recounts?""  So I think there is
nothing, if...Gore runs out of ammunition.  Which I think he
may well do, before the Supreme Court of the United States gets
to a hearing.  I think he has to give up, because there's
nothing...""

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Weather Group

Let,s give a big round of applause to the Weather Team!  Environmental 
Finance Magazine ranked the weather group #1 in Online Services and #1 Dealer 
in the United States and Europe.  Gary Taylor, manager in weather trading, 
comments, ""The ""Best Dealer"" award reflects our counterparties' appreciation 
for the significant effort we have made to drive the growth of our market by 
making two-sided markets where other companies are only willing to quote 
either a bid or an offer.  This award also reflects the innovative nature of 
everyone on our desk, and their ability to price non-standard structures for 
our customers.  It is truly a team award.  The ""Best Online Dealer"" award is 
simply another testament to the unparalleled success of EnronOnline.  By 
providing tight, two-way markets online, we have provided two critical 
elements to generate growth in our market: 1) an element of price discovery, 
and 2) a quick and easy way to transact.""

The Weather Risk Management group launched a new product this week:  Power 
Demand swaps.  These contracts use power demand as an index and allow power 
market participants (generators, btu distributors, marketers, etc...) to 
mitigate volumetric exposures.  The first contract the desk offered is for 
the PJM power pool.  On EnronOnline, weekly swaps are available and the desk 
has placed option contracts on this index in the broker market.  Inquiries 
regarding this product should be directed to Claudio Ribeiro (product 
manager) x37313, Gary Taylor x31511, or Valter Stoiani x36906.

Competitive Analysis and Business Controls
eSource, Enron's premier corporate-wide research group, launched their new 
intranet product, eSearch, on December 1, 2000.  eSource's team of 
specialized researchers have created a web site to bring information and 
research to every employee's desktop.  The eSearch web site offers many links 
to information resources, access to research databases, specialized searches, 
sites to purchase books, articles, and reports, and training.  Employees can 
use the web site to conduct their own research or as a vehicle to submit 
research requests.  eSource's researchers and industry specialists are 
available to all Enron business units to provide timely and cost efficient 
research, to work with individuals or groups to fulfill one time research 
requests, or to design ongoing, customized monitoring projects or news 
updates.

Enron Global Markets Fundamentals
EGM Fundamentals is quickly building a team of expert analysts and associates 
to work directly with traders and marketers.  The team is already busy 
analyzing various commodities and market situations.  For example, an 
initiative is underway to analyze current negative fractionation spreads in 
the market resulting from rising natural gas prices.  Web sites to host this 
analytical information are currently in development for all EGM commodities.  
These sites will provide research and analysis, weather, publications, and 
any other information that will assist in decision-making or identification 
of potential commercial opportunities.  For questions or requests regarding 
fundamental research, contact Jennifer Fraser at x34759.  For questions or 
suggestions regarding the web sites, contact Heather Purcell at x54057.

Austin Energy
Austin Energy and Enron Sandhill, L.L.C, a subsidiary of Enron North America 
broke ground November 29, 2000 for the construction of the Sand Hill Energy 
Center, a 180-megawatt peaking electrical generation facility.  Located in 
eastern Travis County, the Sand Hill Energy Center will be a natural gas 
fired facility that will operate primarily during peak demand periods.  The 
$93.7 million project will feature four 45-megawatt General Electric gas 
turbines and will be operational May 1, 2001.


NEWS FROM THE GLOBALFLASH

Coal
The London dry cargo seafreight team traded 1 million metric tonne of 
Capesize vessel swaps via EOL in one day, (Wednesday 28th November). The deal 
was created by combining OTC options and a physically related cash market 
deal.  This helps to bring our YTD EOL to just under 2.5 mln tonne.

Off-shore wind energy deal
Enron Wind has signed a power purchase agreement with Swedish energy company 
Graninge.  According to the agreement, Graninge will deliver electricity to 
consumers using Enron's wind power plants in southern Sweden.  Enron Wind's 
Utgrunden off-shore wind park, completed this year, will generate in the 
region of 38,000 megawatt hours of electricity, or enough for around 6,000 
average homes between the mainland and the island of Oland on the southeast 
tip of Sweden.  In an announcement this week, Graninge stated that it plans 
to market the power to consumers as 'green' energy.

Happy 1st Birthday EnronOnline!
This week saw EnronOnline celebrate its first birthday.  During the course of 
its first year, EnronOnline has passed a number of milestones including the 
addition of a range of new functionalities for customers on the site.  
EnronOnline has now come of age, having surpassed the $274 billion mark in 
notional value in November.  This represents a total of 478,695 transactions 
since the site was launched on 29 November 1999.

The first anniversary was marked by giving the media guest access to 
EnronOnline in Europe.  A team from Reuters was invited into Enron House to 
receive a full demonstration of EnronOnline and as of today will be able to 
quote in reports live prices from EnronOnline.  Other media outlets are being 
invited to obtain guest access during the coming weeks as the word of 
EnronOnline's success continues to spread...

Australia
Enron Australia continues to assist in the region in a supportive role.  
Elliott Katz worked on the GEM migration in Singapore last week with an IT 
team from London, Oslo and Singapore.  Approximately 40 users, including 
Traders, were migrated to Windows 2000 and the CORP domain.  This is an 
important step for the Asia Pacific region, as it brings the three biggest 
offices (Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo) into line with corporate standards for 
desktop computing.

Japan
E-Power, a JV between Enron and Japanese finance company Orix, has announced 
proposals for a 2000MW gas-fired power plant at Mutsu-Ogawara, an industrial 
area  in northern Japan.   A feasibility study will be undertaken to define 
how the project will go forward and this may include the development of an 
LNG terminal in the vicinity.  The nature of the permitting process is such 
that the plant would not begin operations for six to seven years.  This 
project is just one of several options that E-Power are working on in Japan.

Hi Folks,

I know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a
crazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a
lot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a
mad dash on weeks like this.


Here's the latest on Stephen Davis:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa
shingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington
Post.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a
hairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen
Davis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play

"
"Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.
According to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack
in Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the
Redskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the
injury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point
at which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.
""It hurts now,"" Davis said. ""It's something I have to overcome. They told me
it's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.
[But] I'm hopeful.""
Davis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But
Tyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent
another yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for
85 yards on 19 carries.
""It didn't affect me at all,"" he said. ""We ran the ball a couple times after
it happened and did okay.""
Skip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the
Eagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on
the inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is
sidelined or limited.
The Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive
starters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,
center Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's
third-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with
10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.
Turner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to
the ball. ""That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury,"" Turner
said. ""Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it.""

My View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's
going to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes
anyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll
see Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on
it, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the
Eagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing
allowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the
""tough guy"" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played
Monday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he
played with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about ""leaders stepping
up"" and such.  Stephen Davis' injury appears to be primarily an issue of
managing the pain and I'd be very surprised to see him sit after Green's
performance.
Thanks to my friend J.D. Gardner for his help on this one.

Hope all is well.  Is this in reference to the Enron/Andersen Consulting 
football game?  When is it?  Do you need me to play?  Give me a call and we 
can discuss (3-9557).  

Thanks,

I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our 
plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs.
I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at 
center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at 
blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have 
objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that 
he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).

Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let 
me know.

Let me know what you think.

Hook 'Em!

Ok then.

Do you want to take Dad somewhere for his birthday?  Maybe Thursday night?

I have selected December 7th and 8th as the days for us to get together in 
the Houston office to go over your year.  I will be able to retrieve your 
completed feedback reports by then and hopefully will have spoken to your 
supervisor.  Please send me your availability for those two days.  I will 
need 30 minutes but we should schedule for an hour. Be patient, I am between 
jobs and am my own assistant.  If you cannot meet on either day, (if you are 
in Brazil, for instance) we will work something out. (send a suggestion or 
two)  Please respond to this as soon as possible so I can get everyone 
scheduled.  Thanks

PS Please make sure you are sending emails to Don Black / SA/   not to Don 
Black / EES/  or Donald Black / ENA/
Don't forget to reserve your spot- 


Jen Fraser, Director of Origination in EGM - December 5 from 12 to 1 in 30C1

Practice is absolutely necessary to assure our victory.    So we will have 
several practices this week  (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday... with no 
drinking and a curfew on Friday) and may cancel the scrimmage to schedule in 
more practices.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.


IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball 
and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.   
Eric please bring a couple of footballs.



If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc.



----

Also, Sarah, please bring Gerald to the game.  He helped greatly last year, 
and a stand by would be excellent in the event of injury.

Hi  Folks,

Breaking this into 2 parts  tonight so it's not such a huge email.? I'll have 
the Passing Game  Matchups in this one and the Rushing Game Matchups  will 
follow.? Good luck this week!

Matchups to Avoid  and Exploit.? 

Passing Game  Matchups.?? Here's how I see the matchups this  week.? Please 
note, see the  cheatsheet online http://www.cheatsheets.net/week12sheet.htm? 
for exactly  where I rank playersand to determine who to start.? Just 
because  one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't 
necessarily mean  I'd start the player with the best matchup.? The matchup 
info is meant to be just one  more tool in your box when it comes to deciding 
between players.?? 

Note:? I,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last four 
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mike 
Hall,s excellent FLM League Management Software.? http://www.fflm.com/ for 
more info.? The Fantasy  Points Allowed by Position numbers are from 
ESPN.com.? 

?

Here we go:

Locks:? These games heavily favor the Offense  

New Orleans  Passing Game vs Raider Defense??  Gut check time for  the Saints 
as they deal with life after Ricky.? Most folks know I,m big on synergy 
which  is just one of those $10 words for depending on your teammates.? 
Everyone knows that RBs need a decent  passing game to be effective on the 
ground.? I,m beginning to think however that the  effect isn,t quite as 
pronounced in reverse.? In other words, I don,t believe losing  Ricky 
Williams will hurt QBJeff  Blakeas much as losing  Jeff Blake would have hurt 
Ricky Williams.?  With RBs Chad Morton  andJerald  Moorein the backfield,  I 
look for Blake to air it out against a suspect Raider pass defense.? 
Basically like Donovan McNabb is doing  in Philadelphia.? Over the last 4  
weeks, Oakland ranks # 30 in passing yards allowed per game.? For the year, 
they rank # 23 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing QB.?  WR  Joe 
Hornis by far the  favored target while Keith  Pooleand  Willie  Jacksonmay 
grab a  few.? TE Andrew  Gloveris worth a shot  if you,re in a bind but he,s 
been very  inconsistent.

Atlanta Passing  Game vs 49er Defense?? The 49er defense squashed Elvis  
Grbac owners last week but I,m not quite ready to appoint them QB Killers.? 
They,ve been awful for the year up until  then.? Over the last four weeks,  
they rank # 29 in passing yards allowed per game.? And they rank # 31 for the 
year in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB.?  QB  Chris Chandleris 
back among us  now and the cobwebs seem to be cleared.?  WR  Terrance 
Mathisis by far the  best receiving choice although it,s worth noting that  
Shawn  Jeffersonhad a great game  against this 49er team back in week 1 
(doesn,t that seem like a long time  ago?)? TE Reggie  Kellycould be worth a  
long shot as the 49ers rank # 22 in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing TEs  
although Kelly has done very little of  late.

Minnesota Passing  Game vs Panther Defense??? I,m running out of  adjectives 
to describe the stellar play of QB Daunte  Culpepper.? And I think he,ll keep 
it rolling this  week against a Carolina team that ranks # 26 in passing 
yards allowed per game  over the last four weeks.? Culpepper  creates some 
matchup? problems I  don,t think the Panthers can solve.?  Of course, he,ll 
be throwing to the best WR tandem in the game and that  never hurts.? Both  
Randy  Moss and  Cris  Carterare sure starters  in any league.? Both have a 
great  chance every week of exploding.? I,d  even consider # 3 WR Matthew  
Hatchetteif you,re in the  gambling mood in a very large league.?  The TEs 
aren,t much of a factor here and when they are, the receptions  are spread 
around.

Washington Passing  Game vs Ram Defense?? Jeff  Georgegets another  start in 
place of the injured Brad Johnson after a less than earth shaking  
performance in week 10 vs Arizona (276 yards, 0 TD, 2 interceptions).? 
Fortunately, he gets to face a St. Louis  pass defense that,s still giving up 
lots of yards even with Bud Carson helping  out.? They rank # 23 in passing  
yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? And for the year, they rank 
# 29 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB.?  As much as the Redskins 
would like to control the game with  RBStephen  Davis, you just have to  
think they,ll be forced to throw in order to keep pace with the Rams.? A bye 
week should help things.? WR Albert  Connellhas been the  source of great 
frustration for many Fantasy GMs but this should be a good week  for him.?  
James  Thrashis covering the #  2 WR job and he might be a good roll of the 
dice as well.? TE Stephen  Alexanderdoesn,t seem to  produce the numbers you,
d think he would in this offense, partly because  FB Larry  Centerscatches so 
many  short passes that might have gone to the TE.? 

Carolina  Passing Game vs Viking Defense?? I,m looking for a uptick from  QB  
Steve Beuerleinin this one.? Call it a hunch as he  does have some negatives 
going his way with injuries to his supporting  cast.? RB? Tshimanga  
Biakabutukais iffy, FB?  William  Floydis out and center Frank  Garcia 
(abrasion to his eye) and offensive lineman Matt Campbell (thigh  contusion) 
also were injured during the New Orleans loss.? Coach George Seifert is 
hopeful both can  go Sunday.? On the plus side, he,s  got two physical WRs in 
Donald Hayes and Muhsin Muhammad that  could give the vulnerable Viking CBs 
trouble.? He should have more time to throw this  week against a Viking 
defense that,s only recorded 7 sacks in the last 4  games.? For the year, 
Minnesota  ranks # 26 in passing  yards allowed per game.?  The TE situation 
is still shaking itself out as Kris Mangum looks to be  healthy.? Only thing 
for certain is  no one has really stepped in to fill the Wesley Walls  void.

?

?

Prime Matchups:?  These games favor the Offense?

Green  Bay Passing Game vs Colts Defense?? First off, this assumes  Brett  
Favrecan get healthy.? If he can, I like  the matchup against a Colt team 
that seems to play just good enough to win.? For the year, they rank # 28 in 
passing  yards allowed per game.? It should  be noted, they,ve played better 
lately though ranking # 19 in passing yards  allowed per game over the last 
four weeks.?  Indy seems to jump out early and?  force the other team to play 
catch-up (which they often come close to  doing)? Favre,s struggled with his  
RBs, his WRs and his own health but this could be a game he surprises.? He,s 
kind of a &storybook8 guy and this  would be a great chapter in the book.?  
We,ll see.?  RB  Ahman Greengets the start but he must get his fumbling under 
control.? WR  Antonio Freemanis a likely starter in your league although sort 
of like Favre, he hasn,t  produced like many thought he would.?  Bill  
Schroedercovers the #2 WR and he often sees more passes thrown his way than 
does  Freeman.?  Bubba  Franksis coming on at TE and could be a nice play.

Buffalo  Passing Game vs Chief Defense?? Most folks know I,m not a big  Rob  
Johnsonfan but he,s got a good matchup this week against a KC defense that,s 
been awful  defending the pass.? Over the last  four weeks, they rank # 29 in 
passing yards allowed per game.? For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy  
Points allowed to the opposing QB although there,s a chance DE Eric Hicks 
will  be back this week after missing time with a bad knee and that will help 
the pass  rush (he didn,t practice Wednesday though)?? Johnson will be 
throwing to one of  the game's best WRs in Eric  Moulds.? Not only is Moulds 
ultra talented, but  he draws by far the most targets on his team.? Sharing 
is great for kids but you like  for your Fantasy WRs to be ball hogs.?  
Peerless  Priceand Jeremy  McDanielpick up the scraps.?  RB  Sammy Morrisis 
hobbled so watch that as he,s a solid receiver as well.? TE  Jay Reimersmahas 
been a real disappointment lately although the Chiefs are awful against TEs  
where they rank just # 29 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE.  

Miami  Passing Game vs Jets Defense?? I don,t know if this will be  another 
shootout like they had in their matchup earlier this season but the  
potential for the Dolphins to score some points is definitely there.? The 
Jets rank # 25 in passing yards  allowed per game over the last four weeks.?? 
QB  Jay Fiedlershould have plenty of options available as the Dolphins are 
finally getting WRs  healthy.?  Leslie  Shepherdand Oronde  Gadsdenhave been 
playing well but Tony  Martinand OJ  McDuffieare now in the mix.? He,s 
probably  the least physical of the bunch but I,ve got a pretty good feeling 
for Shepherd  here even though he may not start with Martin healthy.? The 
smashing success of Lamar  Smith is carrying this offense so don,t look for 
too much through the  air for Miami.?  

Tampa  Bay Passing Game vs Bear Defense?? QB  Shaun Kinglooks to continue the 
roll against a Bear team that doesn,t know which way it,s  headed.? The Bears 
are decent  defending the pass ranking # 18 in passing yards allowed per game 
over the last  four weeks but for the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points 
allowed to the  opposing QB.? King,s playing with  confidence and will likely 
keep focusing on getting the ball to # 19,  Keyshawn  Johnson.? (something I 
learned from Sporting News,  Dan Pompei this week about Johnson,s number:? As 
you probably know, Receivers have to  wear numbers in the 80,s.? As a Jet  
rookie, all the 80,s were taken so they allowed him to have # 19.? It was 
such a hit with the fans and NFL  Properties (cha-ching) that even when a 
number in the 80,s came available, the  league granted Johnson an exception 
to keep # 19. It is a cool number for a WR,  I'll admit)? This week, Johnson  
should continue to have success against a suspect Bear Secondary.? Jacquez  
Greenhas really dropped off with King,s new found attraction for Keyshawn 
(wasn,t  going near &Johnson8 in that sentence) RB  Warrick Dunnis a nice 
threat catching the ball and TE  Dave Mooreis a steady performer.

Philadelphia  Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense?? Arizona,s offense is in 
shambles  with injuries all around.? The  trouble is these guys weren,t very 
good to start with, now they,re hurt  too.? What this means is that the  
Eagles could see lots of offensive action this week if the Cardinals can,t 
do  anything when they have the ball.?  Arizona ranks # 17 over the last four 
weeks in passing yards allowed per  game.? But that number will probably  
worsen if QB  Donovan McNabbkeeps throwing the ball 55 times a game as he did 
Sunday.? Philadelphia may be struggling to find a  running game but they,re
